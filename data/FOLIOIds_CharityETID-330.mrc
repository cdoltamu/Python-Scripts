The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) observed in the generation of Ch3 radicals exhibited a dependence on the residence time in the post-reaction zone. Metal oxides differ greatly with respect to their reactivities with Ch3 radicals. Oxides in which the cations exhibit accessible multivalent oxidation states are highly reactive. The reactions of CH3 radicals with these metal oxides are believed to take place via a mechanism in which cations are reduced as a result of the electron transfer from CH3 radicals. The reactions are characterized by small activation energies and sticking coefficients that result from either electron-tunneling or a direct electron transfer which is limited by the weak adsorption of CH3 radicals. The methoxide ions that are produced ultimately form CO2 and CO via formate ions. The addition of Na2CO3 to La2O3, CeO2 and Tb2O3 has marked effect on the catalytic properties of these materials. The effect is most dramatic for CeO2, which, upon addition on Na2CO3, is transformed from a total oxidation catalyst to a reasonably selective catalyst for the formation of C2+ hydrocarbons. A sodium carbonate/oxide phase largely covers the lanthanide oxide surface. Accordingly, the Na/Ln[x]O[y] catalysts are similar to pure Na2CO3 with respect to their catalytic properties. The sodium compound inhibit reactions between CH3 radicals and the underlying metal oxide and provide a new active species, Na2O2. The active and selective NaMnO4/MgO catalyst also was partially covered with a sodium carbonate/oxide phase. Two phases may be responsible for the good performance of the catalyst: a crystalline phase of the structure of Mg6MnO8 and a sodium phase on the surface. The formation of the former is promoted by the presence of Na+ ions. The role of the sodium phase is the same as in Na/Ln[x]O[y] catalysts. 0aMethanexOxidation. 0aMetallic oxides. 0aCatalysis. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLunsford, Jack H.,edegree supervisor.1 aSnthony, Rayford G.,edegree committee member.1 aGoodman, Wayne D.,edegree committee member.1 aRosynek, Michael P.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913401241xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1229781zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747613901&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs135d6c5e-0dbd-32f6-b985-5933e6a8e04ci008879bd-afba-3b60-863e-5a26286d54a504173ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002200197245009600219264001000315300004600325336002600371337002800397338002700425504004100452500001000493502004100503500003900544520241200583650002802995655002703023700004003050700004803090700004603138700005103184710005803235856015603293856007803449856013303527994001203660999007903672in0000129906720200904152729.0960603s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34846108  9AHA5816AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34846108  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaH2521 aHao, Ying,d1964-10aResource management in high-speed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks /cby Ying Hao. 1c1994.  axii, 130 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Since a broadband network has a high bandwidth-delay product, preventive resource managem ent schemes have to be designed to ensure th e probability of network congestion being held below a certain value. Despite preventive schemes, network congestion may still occur due to aggregated and focussed loads. Hence, an adaptive m angem ent scheme should be designed as a compliment to preventive schemes. Admission control is used as a preventive scheme which decides w hether or not to accept a connection upon its request. A m ajor undertaking in the design of such a scheme is the com putational complexity, and an admission control scheme has to make a trade-off between its time-complexity and accuracy. In the Average Renewal Cycle model, the average behavior of the traffic stream in its renewal cycle is formulated, based on which an upper bound on the cell loss probability is obtained. The Resource Decomposition model utilizes the performance model of each individual source in isolation to infer its behavior in a multiplexed traffic stream. The proposed approaches have an advantage over the existing ones in th at they have higher accuracy but almost equal processing overhead. Moreover, the second model can be applied to different cell discarding schemes, which cannot be done in any of the existing approaches. To protect th e transmission quality of information sources in the face of link overload, we propose and evaluate a burst-level adaptive resource m anagem ent scheme. Our scheme reacts to overload situations in an output port by reallocating the resources of the port among th e active sources. Since the network congestion is mainly caused by burst-level traffic fluctuations, the proposed scheme is shown to be effective in protecting the service quality of information sources. The ATM network is developed to support a large variety of application systems. The interplay between the ATM network and these systems is critical for their development. As a case study, m edia synchronization schemes in a distributed m ultimedia systems are examined. We quantify and analyze the correlation between the synchronization quality and the ATM network to provide an insight into the the interplay between th e ATM network and the distributed multimedia system. 4aMajor computer science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLiu, Jyh-Charn,edegree supervisor.1 aBhuyan, Laxmi N.,edegree committee member.1 aKim, Junguk L.,edegree committee member.1 aFeldman, Richard M.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741324931&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554377zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741324931&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffsb387d462-20b9-3300-9426-dfb3da0bd885i0094c066-62d2-3f69-9278-857b3a0eb7ad03667ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100003200197245010400229264001000333300004600343336002600389337002800415338002700443504004100470500001000511502004100521500003900562520189400601650002802495655002702523700004102550700004502591700004502636700004802681710005802729856015602787856007802943856013303021994001203154999007903166in0000129890920200904152729.0960531s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34837966  9AHA5636AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34837966  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaD4671 aDesoi, John Francis,d1963-13aAn outline view model for interacting with structured information systems /cby John Francis Desoi. 1c1994.  axii, 131 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh. D.cTexas A & M Universityd1994  a"Major subject: Computer Science."3 aThis research describes a user interface model for interacting with structured information systems based on outline views. An outline view is a form of hierarchically organized hypertext whereby information can be expanded and contracted dynamically to show varying levels of detail. Unlike other user interface models for structured information systems, the model developed provides a single paradigm for performing all major information system tasks. These tasks include adding, editing, browsing, querying, and reporting.  The outline view model presented by this research is generic; it can be applied to any kind of information that can be modeled as an entity-relationship structure. This includes relational, hierarchical, network, and object-oriented data models as well as many hypertext data models. This contribution is especially significant because it supports the deployment of information intensive applications with very little custom development effort. Given only the entity-relationship schema as input, an implementation of the outline view model would provide a complete information system interface.  The user interface model is evaluated with usability testing. The primary goal of the usability evaluation is to determine the major usability problems related to specification of an outline view from a structured information schema. This is accomplished by an observational evaluation of ten subjects with a prototype implementation of the outline view model. In addition, usability data is provided by the performance statistics collected by the prototype including task time, error rate, and sequence of operation. The usability evaluation identified nine primary usability problems over the ten subjects. Overall usability of the model is very good based on the short learning time, low error rate, correctness, and subjective ratings of the evaluation subjects. 4aMajor computer science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLively, William,edegree supervisor.1 aKoppa, Rodger,edegree committee member.1 aLeggett, John,edegree committee member.1 aSheppard, Sallie,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326141&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554216zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326141&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffsaab0ddbe-760d-37cf-a8f0-8dd7115d75ffi00dc31b0-6e85-3976-9d41-ef8b6d66e14d04198ctm a2200505Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003400223245009200257264001000349300004600359336002600405337002800431338002700459500002800486502004100514500001000555504004100565500004200606520218200648650001502830650001502845650002702860650005302887650004102940650004102981650002403022655002703046700004103073700004803114700004603162700004903208700005203257710005803309856007803367856015603445994001203601999007903613in0000099578820200904152459.0901220s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22880448  9AEX9007AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)22880448  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaA3131 aAkabani Hneide, Gamal,d1962-10aInternal dose calculations for electrons and beta particles /cby Gamal Akabani Hneide. 1c1990.  axii, 252 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The code generated absorbed fractions of energy for monoenergetic electrons for selected source organs. The organs or regions considered were those with high surface to volume ratio, organs with walls, and organs that have subdivisions. The calculated absorbed fractions for electrons supersede the values specified by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) methodology. New estimates of S-values for eighty radionuclides were calculated using the new electron absorbed fractions for 21 combinations of source-target regions. Revised S-values were compared with those presented by MIRD Pamphlet No. 5 Revised. An assumption used in the calculation of S-values was the use of the average energy of the 8 spectra rather than using the full spectra. A study was carried out to assess the limitations of using the average energy of the beta spectra. This assumption was studied by generating electron absorbed fraction profiles for different beta decaying radionuclides in small sphere volumes. Absorbed fractions were calculated using their beta average energy and their full spectra. The use of average beta energies overestimates the absorbed fraction in source region over small volumes. The overestimation is dependent on the beta spectra of the radionuclide. A relationship was found between the absorbed fraction (AF) in source region and the surface-to-volume ratio of the region (S/V). The relation is independent of the geometry of the source region; consequently, there was a unique relation between absorbed fractions of energy in source region and (S/V) ratio tor every radionuclide studied. The EGS4 code was used to calculate absorbed doses to the circulatory system. Absorbed doses per transformation per cm3 delivered to the blood and blood vessel walls for specific radionuclides were calculated for different blood vessel sizes. Absorbed doses to both the blood and blood vessel can be calculated for any radionuclide given the blood vessel radius. This model can be applied to any organ vascular system to assess the dose to tissue and blood. 0aBeta rays. 0aElectrons. 0aBeta ray spectrometry. 7aBeta ray spectrometry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00830900 7aBeta rays.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00830901 7aElectrons.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00907642 4aNuclear Engineering 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPoston, John W.,edegree supervisor.1 aBolch, Wesley E.,edegree committee member.1 aHightower, Dan,edegree committee member.1 aMcLain, Milton E.,edegree committee member.1 aScglapper, Gerald A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1109077zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747347201&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs41e53c93-dc4d-3697-b339-d8c9f3abcefai00f961a7-4de4-3c14-a1a4-ff4fb6daa0d104194ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100002700223245007100250264001000321300004500331336002600376337002800402338002700430500002800457502006000485500001000545504005700555520240100612650002503013650002103038650002303059650002703082655002703109700004303136700004503179700004203224700004303266700004503309710005803354856007703412856015603489994001203645999007903657in0000074138620190325092138.0881227s1987    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm18942484  9ADH0871AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)18942484  aTXAM  a1987aDissertationaS6741 aSnowder, Gary Douglas.10aGenetic analysis of reproductive performance of Rambouillet sheep. 1c1987.  axi, 104 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Genetically stable years for genetic parameters estimation were determined by ANOVA and testing for differences between years (P<.01). Data utilized for genetic parameter estimation included the years 1959 to 1985 with 6017 ewes mated to 293 rams. EBV was attained by modifying a standard EBV equation for repeated measures, improved by the use of repeatability and heritability estimates for number of lambs born within each age group. Heritability estimates increased linearly from age 2 to 7 yr (.30, SE =.10 to.64, SE =.20), except for age 5 yr (.41, SE =.08), suggesting an age or parity effect on gene expression. Frequency of multiple births increased between the ages of 2 and 6 yr (4.7 to 21.0%). Selection of twin born ewes over single born as breeding replacements was suggested by their higher frequency of multiple births (35.8 vs 33.6) and number of lambs born to age 8 yr (8.4 vs 8.0), without any significant negative effect on fleece weight (P<.01). No freemartin effects on twin born ewes were observed on pre- and postnatal growth for birth weight, fleece weight, number of lambs born and body weight (P<.05). Fleece weights decreased as the number of lambs reared increased: 4.2, 4.0, 3.9 and 3.8 kg for ewes with 0, 1, 2, 3 lambs, respectively. The genetic correlation between fleece weight and the average number of lambs born was $-.18$. The relationship of a ewe's body weight to lamb production was identified as curvilinear with lighter and extremely heavier ewes having lower rates of reproduction. A body weight range of 54.5 to 64.0 kg was found to have the highest frequency of multiple births and average number of lambs born. Selection for mature breeding weight could be accomplished with a high degree of accuracy at the age of 3 yr (.88). A genetic correlation of.26 was derived for average breeding weight and average number of lambs born. Longevity was not influenced by birth type of the ewe (P<.05).

However, no "perfect" TLD phosphor has been discovered due to the rigid constraints that must be met, such as energy independence, low fading rate, sensitivity, ability to measure neutron dose, etc. Because facilities can have several different radiation fields based on radiation type and energy, it can be a challenge to measure accurately the dose under all normal exposure scenarios. In addition, the medical field uses TLD's in a variety of circumstances where it would be advantageous to have a dosimeter type that can be used in different radiation fields with minimal adjustments to the analysis process. Thermoluminescent dosimeter elements based on a mixture of TLD phosphors in powder form have been investigated to determine the possible advantages that mixtures may offer. The mixture under study has been shown to be stable chemically, and experimental results indicate that photon energy independence has been achieved from 20 keV to 662 keV. Also, the beta radiation response per unit absorbed dose for the mixture was determined to be approximately 0.8 times the response per unit absorbed dose for 662 keV photons. In addition, the thermal neutron response of the mixture for a fluence of 3.6x10^10 n/cm^2 was measured to be approximately 600 times the response per rad for 662 keV photons. 4aMajor nuclear engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPoston, John W.,edegree supervisor.1 aBolch, Wesley E.,edegree committee member.1 aBrake, Richard J.,edegree committee member.1 aMcLain, Milton E.,edegree committee member.1 aWatson, Rand L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1525992zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745760061&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs5d2344b9-c2e7-31d7-b97f-6bfdab8a0fe7i06e90b84-0ccf-3156-8f7b-f6c9d3df73ba03419ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099003200194100003900226245010300265264001000368300004700378336002600425337002800451338002700479500002800506502004100534500001000575504004100585500003300626520140300659650004502062650002802107650002902135650002202164655002702186700004402213700004502257700004702302700004902349710005802398856016902456856007702625856015602702994001202858999007902870in0000078241720200904152412.0890907s1988    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm20310395  9ADM2842AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)20310395  aTXAM  a1988aDisser-atationaA4151 aAl-Khalidi, Hussein Rashid,d1952-10aAspects of quantitative cancer dose-response modeling and the role of the lognormal distribution / 1c1988.  axvii, 139 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The multistage model is currently the most widely used cancer dose-response model. Several characteristics of the multistage model iterative estimation procedure are derived; namely, the concavity of the likelihood function, the use of Akaike's information criterion to select the degree of the model, the derivation of initial parameter estimates, and the use of Kuhn-Tucker conditions as stopping criteria. Current dose-response models including the multistage model have limited biological rationale and tend to greatly oversimplify the carcinogenic process. To incorporate more science into the cancer dose-response models, Sielken (1987) proposed a new family of models. The lognormal is an important part of these new models. To make the new models more tractable, approximations and alternatives to the lognormal density are proposed. Often there are problems in choosing between the lognormal distribution and the normal distribution. Hypothesis testing procedures based on the likelihood ratio test for these two non-nested families are suggested and examined. In a large scale simulation study, the critical values and corresponding powers of the suggested procedures were obtained. Some of the consequences of assuming normality when the underlying distribution is lognormal are determined and illustrated. 0aCarcinogensxDose-response relationship. 0aLognormal distribution. 0aCarcinogenicity testing. 4aMajor statistics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aSielken, Robert L.,edegree supervisor.1 aCurry, Guy L.,edegree committee member.1 aMatis, James H.,edegree committee member.1 aNewton, H.

Mite reproduction was examined from cohorts of infested honey bees of known age dissected at regular intervals over four seasons. Duration of mite reproduction paralleled host longevity. Mites reproduced and progeny dispersed over a short duration (35 days) prior to the death of short lived bees (<40 days) in spring and summer. Longer lived winter bees harbored immature mites for the majority of the 120 days over which they were sampled. Numbers of mites peaked when bees were ca. 24 days old regardless of eventual host longevity. Oviposition by daughter females within the same host was revealed. A model of mite reproduction was developed to evaluate hypotheses of a second, or partial second generation of mites. The hypothesis of a complete second generation was supported when bees were infested with a low initial foundress mite population (one mite/bee), and lived 45-80 days. The alternative hypothesis of a partial second generation was supported by data from short lived bees, in which oviposition by daughters was limited. No oviposition by daughters was apparent when more than 2-3 foundress mites occupy a tracheal tube. Two foundress mites per tracheae may be the maximum for optimal reproduction. Resource deterioration limiting mite reproduction may involve physiological aging of the host, deterioration of the tracheal wall from mite feeding, or other unknown factors. The effects of methoprene (a mimic of host juvenile hormone) on mite reproduction were examined and no effects were evident. Dispersal by mated foundress's daughters to new host bees was a random process. Mite dispersals at night were eight times greater than corresponding daytime mite dispersals. No increases in daytime mite dispersals were observed when comparing confined and free flying infested bees of foraging age from the same colony. Host bees were physically less active at night, perhaps influencing the nocturnal dispersal pattern of mites. Mean flight times of infested and uninfested worker bees were not significantly different. The longevity of infested worker bees was slightly less than uninfested siblings. 0aHoneybeexParasitesxLife cycles. 0aMitesxLife cycles. 0aHost-parasite relationships. 4aMajor entomology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aTeel, P.

The approach describes both a methodology, called EVIDENCE, and a complementary software tool. The EVIDENCE methodology provides a set of steps and guidelines for gathering, interpreting and applying end-user data to refining a software prototype. The software support tool integrates evaluation information, including video-recordings and related structured annotations, into a software development environment. Together the methodology and supporting software improve the ability of small development teams to efficiently learn from end-users during iterative design. The approach fills a methodological gap in the software engineering field. Detailed results are presented through an extended case study. The case study involved two design cycles for a moderately complex graphical design environment. Results from six end-user sessions are presented. Complete transcripts and summary results produced according to the methodology are provided in appendices. In the case study, the first iteration identified 32 end-user problems and implemented design solutions to nine problems. The second iteration identified 64 problems, 32 of which were selected for implementation. EVIDENCE prescribes a simple rating system for the user impact of problems and a classification system for proposed solutions. A new concept of "implementation depth" is introduced for classifying solutions. Classification by implementation depth gives an indication of how fundamental a design change is and guides the search for more fundamental changes where practical. The research describes a software design and prototype to capture and manipulate information developed while applying EVIDENCE. The software design provides a simple but adequate data model. The prototype shows how a user interface can provide convenient access to the evaluation information through workstation software. This approach to software support coupled with the EVIDENCE methodology shows how the technological marriage of computers and television can be harnessed to provide more user-centeredness in a software development environment. 0aDatabase design. 0aObject-oriented databases. 0aComputer softwarexDevelopment. 0aHuman engineering. 4aMajor computer science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLively, William M.,edegree supervisor.1 aFriesen, Donald K.,edegree committee member.1 aKoppa, Rodger J.,edegree committee member.1 aSheppard, Sallie V.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1447163zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746517371&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd82407a5-6048-315b-bc99-b2ef5fb3dc4ci0d8ddb8d-db60-3fbf-a076-4c2272f4cd0704226ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004900109035002000158049000900178099003000187100003300217245013400250264001000384300004600394336002600440337002800466338002700494500002800521502004100549500001000590504004100600500005300641520214800694650002502842650003302867650001902900650002102919650004302940655002702983700004403010700004303054700004703097700004803144710005803192856016903250856007803419856015603497994001203653999007903665in0000099827120200904152519.0910121s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22989901  9AEY7921AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)22989901  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaM12651 aMcClain, William Ray,d1953-10aNutritional components of forage-based food systems and their contribution to growth of juvenile crawfish (Procambarus clarkii) / 1c1990.  axii, 116 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

More precise nutritional information about this forage-based system should facilitate its management for crawfish production. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the nutrient composition of rice during decomposition, to determine the gross trends in biomass of associated microorganisms and their effect on crawfish growth, and to estimate the contribution of separable fractions of available food resources to crawfish growth. A three-part approach was undertaken to address these objectives. In part one, preboot rice (variety Mars) underwent aerobic decomposition at 22.5[plus or minus]1.5°C with pond water and soil for various intervals of time. Nutrient profiles (ash, crude protein, crude lipid, cell-wall content and C:N ratio) of rice and its products of decomposition varied according to plant portion and decomposition time. In general, decomposition decreased crude lipid content and C:N ratio while ash, cell-wall and protein contents increased over time. The second part of the research consisted of a series of feeding experiments in a flow-through tank system to assess the contribution of single feedstuffs to growth of juvenile crawfish (Procambarus clarkii) housed individually. The ability of juvenile crawfish to use plant components for growth was limited, compared with their ability to use a prepared feed (Dupont's Crawdeaux[TM]); and, their ability to use detritus varied directly with the total biomass of associated microbes. The last part of the research focused on crawfish growth in static-water microcosms with and without various components of the detrital food chain and the prepared feed. The growth data were used to fit a multiple linear model with zero intercept to estimate contribution to growth from separable components of the treatments. These were--in order of importance--prepared feed, microbially-enriched detrital forage, soil benthos, soil substrate and possibly meiofauna and larger organisms associated with detritus. 0aCrayfishxNutrition. 0aProcambarus clarkiixGrowth. 0aForage plants. 0aRicexNutrition. 4aMajor wildlife and fisheries sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGatlin, Delbert M.,edegree supervisor.1 aNeill, William H.,edegree supervisor.1 aDavis, James T.,edegree committee member.1 aRowe, Gilbert T.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:902724941xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1117137zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747347901&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs8ee20ce4-44dd-3e50-8d6b-56c0aa8f817fi0dba3b68-4250-3928-87b1-8468770e63e604012ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099002900201100003100230245012600261264001000387300002800397336002600425337002800451338002700479504004100506500001000547502004100557500004900598520176400647650006202411650005402473650005102527650003802578650007202616650006202688650005102750651004502801655004402846655002702890700004102917700005002958700005103008700005203059710005803111856007803169856015603247994001203403999007903415in0000118073520200904152637.0940629s1992    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm30687674  9AGG8999AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)30687674  an-us---  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaS6721 aSnider, Rose Marie,d1928-14aThe practice of Jeffersonian democratic ideals in selected contemporary American high schools :ba naturalistic inquiry / 1c1992.  aix, 250 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

If a nation is to remain unified, the citizens of that nation must share common values, goals, and ideals. That the school should serve as an agent of dissemination of those common values has been a recurring theme of reform movements throughout the past century. The multiple values demanded of the school system by numerous interest groups has forced administrators to ask which of those roles is most important. Lacking national consensus, administrators look to local constituents for guidance. This research examined three high schools in the United States to determine the ways in which socialization for democratization takes place. The examples included a rural high school in the Texas hill country, a suburban high school in a suburb of Seattle, Washington, and an urban high school in Charlottesville, Virginia. This sample represents diverse geographic areas as well as diverse populations. Based on the naturalistic method of inquiry, the study reveals the similarities and differences among the three schools in their socialization practices. It also reveals that administrators, faculty, and students consider it important that the school fulfill its role of providing students the opportunity to become a well-educated informed citizenry in order to preserve the democratic system of government in this nation. Though they use different methods and emphasize different democratic principles, the three schools examined do fulfill their role of socialization for democratization. 0aDemocracyxStudy and teaching (Secondary)zUnited States. 0aEducation and statezUnited StatesvCase studies. 0aEducationzUnited StatesxAims and objectives. 4aMajor educational administration. 7aDemocracyxStudy and teaching (Secondary)2fast0(OCoLC)fst00890116 7aEducationxAims and objectives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00902507 7aEducation and state.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00902835 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 7aCase studies.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423765 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWest, Philip T.,edegree supervisor.1 aBradford, James C.,edegree committee member.1 aErlandson, David A.,edegree committee member.1 aWhetten, Clifford L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1387072zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747453051&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd691f332-a5b6-33f3-941d-7e7cf2018238i0edf7c23-1723-39f6-a939-2b7922bcbef104166ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002900218245015200247264001000399300004500409336002600454337002800480338002700508504004100535500001000576502004100586500003700627520231900664650002102983650002303004650002003027650002603047655002703073700004603100700004503146700004503191700004403236700004503280710005803325856007803383856015603461994001203617999007903629in0000119851720200904152640.0940928s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31191594  9AGJ0434AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31191594  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaT7271 aToure, Aboubacar,d1956-10aHeterosis, combining ability, and breeding potential studies for grain yield and yield components in guinea sorghums [Sorghum bicolor (L.)

In an attempt to determine why West African sorghums display low yield potential, 7 converted guinea, 4 zerazera, and 2 caudatum sorghums were crossed to three improved A-lines. Parents and hybrids were evaluated for general and specific combining ability at Halfway and College Station, Texas during 1989 and 1990. In general, non-guineas were better combiners than guineas for yield and most yield components. Guineas showed low additive effects for grain yield, seeds/panicle, and seed size. This could be explained by the stability of grain yield of guineas over a wide range of environments. Guineas seem to maintain a relative low yield by reducing the number of seeds/panicle and seed size. Most guinea hybrids showed positive heterosis over the best parent for yield. This indicated that guineas possess some genes or factors contributing to higher yield expression. In general, the guinea hybrids had more primary branches/panicle, more whorls/panicle, greater panicle length, and more exsertion than non-guinea hybrids. Guineas showed some specific combining ability. The principal component analysis indicated that the first component was a measure of yield and yield components, while the second component described architecture of the plant. The best yielding cultivars were non-guinea combinations. Although guinea hybrids showed lower yield, some heterotic response for grain yield existed. For yield and plant architecture, zerazera was found to be related to caffrorum and caudatum. Caudatum and caffroum were less related to conspicuum (guineas). Diversity was found between conspicuum and caffrorum, caudatum, and zerazera. Evolutionary, conspicuums apparently evolved differently from these latter groups. During their evolution, adaptation, and stabilization guineas accumulated primarily genes or factors which contributed to stability of grain yield and to such traits as hard grain with resistance to mold, weathering, and insect damage rather than genes that contributed to high yield. However, contrary to some belief of sorghum scientists, there appears to be breeding value in guineas with regard to improvement of grain yield and related traits. 0aSorghumxGrowth. 0aSorghumxBreeding. 0aHybrid sorghum. 4aMajor plant breeding. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMiller, Frederick R.,edegree supervisor.1 aRosenow, Darrell T.,edegree supervisor.1 aRooney, L.

Subjects were problem drinkers on probation for two or more DWI offenses, and nonproblem drinkers were those on probation for offenses other than DWI with no prior problem drinking or substance abuse history. Examination of ethnicity and drinking status effects using two-way analysis of covariance indicated no significant difference in MAC-R mean scores among the three ethnic groups; however, problem drinkers obtained significantly higher MAC-R mean scores than nonproblem drinkers. Evaluation to determine the MAC's ability in classifying problem drinkers from nonproblem drinkers was conducted by dividing the sample into an estimation sample (n = 180) and a cross-validation sample (n = 90). The estimation sample was used to examine classification accuracy of various cutting scores by determining overall hit rates, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power (PPV), and negative predictive power (NPV). Modest discriminative validity was obtained on cutting scores from 23 to 27; however, a cutting score of 26 achieved the best hit rate (62.2%) with optimal balance between sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. Application of the five cutting scores from the estimation sample to the cross-validation sample resulted in relatively little validity shrinkage, but because only modest validity was obtained in the estimation sample, the decline was of sufficient magnitude that none of the cutting scores achieved hit rates greater than chance. Item analysis of the 49 MAC-R items revealed that significant ethnic differences in response patterns occurred on Items 387, 407, and 422 for problem drinkers and Items 69, 82, 202, 299, and 407 for nonproblem drinkers. Overall findings indicated that the MAC-R has at best moderate validity in differentiating problem and nonproblem drinkers in a misdemeanor population, and that while ethnicity effects were not significant at the group mean score level, differences in responses occurred at the item level. 0aAlcoholism and crimevCross-cultural studies. 0aMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. 0aMinoritiesxAlcohol use. 0aAlcoholicsxPsychological testing. 4aMajor counseling psychology. 7aCross-cultural studies.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423769 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDuffy, Michael,edegree supervisor.1 aDennis, Maurice E.,edegree committee member.1 aKapes, Jerome T.,edegree committee member.1 aReilley, Robert R.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1432634zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746982781&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsee2ddd4d-6dd0-3823-935e-5ecb7d394013i12184a62-b1aa-3528-8ddd-478dc857a98c04249ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002800168100003800196245017600234264001000410300004600420336002600466337002800492338002700520504004100547500001000588502004100598500003300639520240400672650002303076655002703099700004403126700004503170700004703215700004903262710005803311856015603369856007803525856013303603994001203736999007903748in0000129958020200904152730.0960605s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34877640  9AHA6365AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34877640  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaI441 aIngalls, Christopher Paul,d1965-14aThe effects of clenbuterol and interval training on exercise performance and myosin light chain isoform expression in mouse skeletal muscle /cby Christopher Paul Ingalls. 1c1994.  axii, 183 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the separate and combined effects of clenbuterol (CB) and interval training on running performance and myosin light chain (LC) isoform expression in mouse skeletal muscle. Mice were randomly assigned to one of four treatm ent groups: 1) control (CON), 2) exercise (EX), 3) drug (CB), or 4) exercise+drug (EX+CB). CB and EX+CB mice were given CB (1.6 mg/kg) orally 4 days/week. EX and EX +C B mice were trained 4 days/week on a motorized treadmill (3 sets of 3 min, 36-40 m/min, 6-10° grade, 30 s recovery). Exercise performance was determined before and after 8 weeks o f treatment with a run-to-exhaustion test. Following 8 weeks of treatment, exercise conditioning increased total work (58%), while clenbuterol decreased total work (25%) on the treadmill. The simultaneous application of both treatments did not cause significant changes in work after eight weeks of treatment. Comparisons between treatments at the post-study exercise test indicated that the CON, CB, and EX +CB were not significantly different from each other, whereas, the EX group exhibited markedly greater exercise performance than the other groups. Gel electrophoresis indicated that neither the separate nor combined treatments promoted any changes (p>.05) in fast and slow myosin LC isoforms. Although not different from each other after 8 weeks, CB and EX+CB treatments produced greater values than CON for the following variables: muscle mass (25-34%), total protein (17- 50%), and myofibrillar protein (26-81%). There were no differences between EX and CON animals for any of these morphological variables. It was concluded: 1. Interval training enhances exercise performance without quantitatively altering total or myofibrillar protein contents. 2. Clenbuterol may decrease work indirectly by promoting muscle hypertrophy. 3. The adaptations in exercise performance are not a consequence of qualitative changes in the expression of myosin LC isoforms. 4. The combination of the two treatments have antagonistic effects on total work, while the two treatments do not interact to diminish the muscle-specific anabolic effects. 4aMajor kinesiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBarnes, William S.,edegree supervisor.1 aTolson, Homer,edegree committee member.1 aLawler, John M.,edegree committee member.1 aSmith, Stephen B.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741324971&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554898zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741324971&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffse24a5097-0d26-379e-be55-b7bcd119de00i139347bf-71ee-3600-80bf-b172d186733103407ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099002900201100002600230245008700256264001000343300004600353336002600399337002800425338002700453500002800480502005500508500001000563504005800573500003300631520158200664650003902246650004302285650001502328655002702343700004102370700004702411700005602458700005302514710005802567856007702625856015602702994001202858999007902870in0000041460120190325091752.0870108s1984    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm15044629  9ABW0062AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdTXA  a(OCoLC)15044629  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1984aDissertationaP3921 aPeloquin, John Joseph10aSwarming behavior of Psorophora columbiae (Dyar and Knab) in East Texas ricelands. 1c1984.  axiv, 131 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Swarming begins at specific times at dusk and dawn depending on the illumination levels and thus the sun angle at the sites of swarming. Swarming of Ps. columbiae males usually began approximately 40 m after sunset and the swarming behavior of this species is similar in many respects to that of Aedes sollicitans and other mosquito species. Psorophora columbiae swarming behavior was preceded by a mass ascension of mosquitoes from their pre-swarm resting places in vegetation. Male Ps. columbiae in marker swarms were sensitive to sounds of 200 to 500 Hz. Mating was not definitively observed in a swarm; however, it is likely that mating occurs near the sites of swarms and close to the time of swarming. Beetles as well as other mosquito species were associated with Ps. columbiae swarms. A technique developed by Schlein and Gratz (1972) to determine the ages of Anopheles mosquitoes was not accurate for Ps. columbiae. A remote-piloted flying sampler vehicle successfully captured flying mosquitoes and chironomids. A model for prediction of the initiation of swarming behavior by Ps. columbiae males in East Texas ricelands was developed. Prediction of mosquito swarms can be used as part of an integrated pest control strategy. 0aMosquitoesxBehaviorzTexas, East. 0aRicexDiseases and pestszTexas, East. 4aEntomology 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aOlson, Jimmy K.,edegree supervisor.1 aMeola, Roger W.,edegree committee member.1 aPlapp, Frederick W., Jr.,edegree committee member.1 aRussell, Leon H., Jr.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/Dissertations-438542zLink to OAKTrust Copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=751348941&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to ProQuest Copy  aC0bTXAffs82673822-a0f3-3dd2-bab7-09b749208d61i14ec7e61-76da-3672-93c8-9e4e91e9f9a403997ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099003000189100002200219245004000241264001000281300004600291336002600337337002800363338002700391504004100418500001000459502004100469500004500510520210300555650002702658650004102685650002102726650004702747650003602794650003402830655002702864700004302891700004202934700005302976700004903029700005403078710005803132856007803190856015603268994001203424999007903436in0000119852220200904152622.0940928s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31191648  9AGJ0439AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31191648  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaH87431 aHuang, Chun-Jack.10aShape conceptualization in design / 1c1992.  axiv, 202 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

This dissertation focuses on two central issues: (1) how are design concepts formed in response to the perception of problem needs and requirements in the conceptual design stage and (2) how can these concepts be represented and manipulated in a computer to provide the designer with effective automated support during conceptualization process? The first question is approached by an analysis of the cognitive skills needed in concept formation. Concept formation is a process used by designers to transform ill-structured problems into structural descriptions of a design. In this process, the designer individuates the perceived information into a set of perceived concepts. The perceived concepts are then categorized into concrete and abstract concepts depending on whether they correspond to image or non-image information (e.g., propositions). Finally, through association between concepts the interrelationships between concepts are formulated. The second question is approached by an analysis of the way the designer describes shapes in the design process. As a result of this analysis, a shape description process is proposed which supports the designer by providing a set of self-evident shape operations which is intuitive to the designer as well as executable in a computer-based design environment. These two major cognitive processes in conceptual design are identified as concept formation and shape description. The rationale for these processes was based on an examination of the cognitive processing activities required (1) to understand a design problem, (2) to realize the intended design by creating mental models of the design, and (3) to describe the mental models to the design environment. Shape conceptualization in design encompasses the design knowledge and cognitive skills of a human designer as well as the representation schemes and design tools supported by CAD systems... 0aComputer-aided design. 0aEngineering designxData processing. 0aCAD/CAM systems. 0aConceptual structures (Information theory) 0aVisualizationxData processing. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMayer, Richard J.,edegree supervisor.1 aPhillips, Don T.,edegree supervisor.1 aGriffith, Patricia B.,edegree committee member.1 aMalave, Ceaser O.,edegree committee member.1 aMenzel, Christopher P.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1397365zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746516921&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs9578cd05-e2b3-3949-a60a-65a4d4f9ae60i15279277-74bf-3581-8923-9a07ef0393b104298ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160050002600180049000900206099002900215100004200244245006100286264001000347300004500357336002600402337002800428338002700456500002800483502004100511500001000552504004100562500004300603520245200646650002103098650003003119650001303149650001603162650003203178655002703210700004803237700004903285700005003334700004903384710005803433856007803491856015603569994001203725999007903737in0000115510320200904152635.0930920s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm28855895  9AGC7630AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)28855895 4aTP1175.M44bR83 1992a  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaR9211 aRuengphrathuengsuka, Wirogana,d1958-10aBubble nucleation and growth dynamics in polymer melts / 1c1992.  axi, 184 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This work involves extending classical nucleation theory to include elastic and non-ideal solution effects. Laboratory studies characterize gas solubility/diffusivity in polymers and surface tensions of polymer with dissolved gas. Free expansion foaming studies characterize property, structure, and operating condition effects. The experimental studies were conducted on LDPE/HDPE samples, and mixtures thereof, using N2, Ar, and CO2 as the gas blowing agents. In addition, the effects of solid nucleating agents on the foaming process were also studied. With the cahn balance, the solubility/diffusivity data were obtained by thermogravimetric method and the surface tension by a Wilhelmy method over 250-350 °F and pressures upto 1800 psi. The free expansion foaming was conducted in a specially constructed high temperature/pressure cell. The final foam structure is largely governed by the bubble nucleation events which are affected by gas solubility, surface tension, and the presence of agents to promote heterogeneous nucleation. Viscous and elastic effects and the non-ideal mixing effects of gas-polymer solution tend to decrease nucleation. Highly non-ideal solubilities of gases in LDPE/HDPE increased with temperature unlike those observed in the low pressure Henry's law region. A modified Flory-Huggins theory represents the data quite accurately with a free parameter (interaction parameter). Gas diffusivity was insensitive to dissolved gas concentrations upto 120 ATM and increased slightly with temperature. The Wilhelmy method on the Cahn balance was found to be an effective method for measuring surface tension of polymer melts with dissolved gas. The surface tension of the LDPE-N2 decreases significantly with dissolved gas concentration. Such surface tension lowering is critically important to achieve efficient nucleation in foaming processes. Low density foams can be obtained using a high solubility gas and allowing the bubble growth state to mature before quenching. Very fine structures can be achieved with high bubble nucleation system. Significant bubble-bubble coalescence occurred which broadened the cell size distributions. In general these studies provide a number of insights into polymer foam processing mechanism. 0aPolymer melting. 0aPlastic foamsxStructure. 0aBubbles. 0aNucleation. 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aFlumerfelt, Raymond W.,edegree supervisor.1 aGiacomin, Alan J.,edegree committee member.1 aGlover, Charles J.,edegree committee member.1 aSlattery, John C.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1348951zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744913111&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2eb154d0-f42b-324f-bd7d-9464f5999c30i1529acf1-31a0-3bbe-ae30-48dff2cd5cc003852ctm a2200433Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003500109035002000144049000900164099002900173100003700202245014100239264001000380300004700390336002600437337002800463338002700491504004100518500001000559502004100569500003200610520186900642650002102511655002702532700004302559700004502602700004302647700004302690710005802733856016902791856015602960856007803116856013303194994001203327999007903339in0000130057520200904152731.0960515s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34738127  9AHA3046AM  aTXAbengcTXAdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34738127  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaK1671 aKannisto, Michael Rodney,d1967-14aThe solubilization of transition-metal complexes into aqueous media for use in biphasic catalytic systems /cby Michael Rodney Kannisto. 1c1994.  axvii, 131 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

RuCl2(PTA)4 is an effective catalyst for the regioselective conversion of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols using a biphasic aqueous/organic medium with sodium formate as teh source of hydrogen, thus affording facile catalyst recovery and recycle. Both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes were reduced to the corresponding alcohols. The formate ion was shown to directly be the hydrogen source by deuterium labelling experiments. The rate of hydrogenation of benzaldehyde was found to be first-order in catalyst concentration, first-order in substrate concentration, and independent of formate concentrations >2.5M. The reduction process was greatly retarded by the presence of excess phosphine ligand. The apparant activation energy determined was 23.9 kcal-mol. A catalytic cycle was proposed which involves the rapid formation of a ruthenium hydride formate complex followed by phosphine dissociation and aldehyde addition in a slower step. Subsequent formation of a metal alkoxide intermediate and protoantion completes the cycle. Recycling experiments demonstrated the catalyst to be quite robust. A series of 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane complexes of group VI metal carbonyl complexes were also prepared. Reaction of M(CO)4(NHC5H10)2 with PTA in dichloromethane yields the complexes of group VI metal carbonyl complexes were also prepared. Reaction of M(CO)4(PTA)2(M=W, Mo), while the reaction of W(CO)3(C5H5N)3 with PTA in THF yields W(CO)3(PTA)3. The following complexes were characterized by X-ray crystallography: RuCl2(PTA)4, RuCl2(PTA)2(PTAH)2*2Cl, RuCl4(PTAH)2*Cl, W(CO)4(PTA)2, Mo(CO)3(PTAH)3*3Cl, 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamentane oxide. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDarensbourg, D.J.,edegree supervisor.1 aHughbanks, T.,edegree committee member.1 aGoodman, W.,edegree committee member.1 aGadella, A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:943270541uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900121&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551731zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900121&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs8a683496-32ac-372a-ad39-140c8f49f9c1i15b58325-6cae-3aa6-850e-ee2e5e622e0c03074cam a2200397K  4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035002000095035001400115040003500129035001900164049000900183099002800192100002900220245007800249264003500327300003000362336002600392337002800418338002700446502006300473520145700536650003601993655002702029700004002056700004802096700004602144700005402190700005002244710005802294856007702352856015602429994001202585999007902597in0000015393820190325091136.0791119s1969    txua     m    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm05713007  a(OCoLC)05713007  9AAT3529AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)5713007  aTXAM  a1969aDissertationaE411 aEl Hag, Hassan El Tayeb.10aMechanical and physical properties of cotton (Gossypium Hirsutum) stalks. 1a[College Station, Tex.]c1969.  a148 leavesbillustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  bPh.

Sections 6 inches in length were selected and used for the test specimens. Tensile, flexural and shear forces were measured by a load cell which was mounted on a tension-compression apparatus and connected to an X-Y recorder. The recorder gave charts of the force versus loading time for each specimen. These charts were used to obtain the dependent variables of 1) modulus of elasticity, 2) ultimate tensile, flexural and shear strengths and 3) specific shear energy, by appropriate equations and other observed data. A pendulum-type cutting apparatus with 1/8 and 1/16-inch thick blades was used to measure the specific cutting energy. Independent variables of 1) moisture content, 2) dry matter density, 3) rate of loading, 4) specimen location along the stalk and 5) blade thickness, were studied. Different levels of the independent variables were considered and a completely randomized block design involving factorial treatment combinations was used. Factorial analyses of variance were conducted and significant results were obtained. Simple and multiple regression equations were developed to relate the dependent variables to the independent variables. Curves showing moisture content distribution along the stalk and the effect of drying time on this distribution were developed. Also, bark thickness and pith diameter distributions along the stalk are given. 4aMajor agricultural engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKunze, Otto R.,edegree supervisor.1 aHiler, Edward A.,edegree committee member.1 aKlipple, E.

Flow temperature and pressure conditions were those typically found in air-conditioner and heat pump applications. Effects of each operating parameters and short tube geometry on the flow rate were discussed and included in the modeling. Both an analytical and semi-empirical model were developed. These models allowed better prediction of mass flow rate and investigation of transport properties inside the short tube. Generally, the flow trends for both refrigerants were similar even though mass flow rate range for HFC-134a was 30 % lower than that for HCFC-22 due to lower operating pressure conditions. Within normal heat pump or air-conditioner operating conditions, second-stage choking (choking at the outlet) was only approximated because the flow showed a small dependency on downstream pressure. For the conditions investigated, the mass flow rate was directly proportional to upstream pressure and upstream subcooling, but it showed only a small dependency on downstream pressure. For two-phase flow entering the short tube, the flow rate decreased with increasing quality. The mass flow rate was found to be dependent on cross sectional area, chamfer depth, and short tube length. For subcooled liquid entering the short tube, the delay of flashing, i.e. metastable liquid flow, was observed at the inlet section of the short tube. It was observed that the effects of oil concentration on mass flow rate varied as a function of short tube geometry and upstream subcooling or quality. The semi-empirical flow model and flow charts for both single and two-phase flow were developed by empirically correcting the modified single-phase orifice equation to satisfy the short tube orifice flow. For both HCFC-22 and HFC-134a, the maximum difference between measured data and the model's prediction was within [plus or minus]10%... 0aTwo-phase flow. 0aHeatxTransmission. 0aRefrigerantsxTesting. 4aMajor mechanical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aO'Neal, Dennis L.,edegree supervisor.1 aAnand, N.

This environment is designed to assist scientific programmers in overcoming the semantic gap between the formulation of the mathematical model of a physical system and the code for solving that model. The environment is part of a larger view of literate programming than has been proposed and is designed to interact with WEB systems. The inputs to the environment are a standardized description of the mathematical system of differential, integro-differential, and algebraic equations. It is desired to use a power series integrator. This integrator is: (1) faster than standard Runge-Kutta or multistep integrators, (2) robust in that it works equally well with stiff and non-stiff problems, and (3) convenient and fast in solving problems with convolution integral terms. A parser has been created to convert the standardized description into statements in a typical high level language for inclusion into a computer program. The use of these integrators has previously required significant manual algebra. The prototype system developed and reported here removes this manual requirement. Conclusions and recommendations for further study and how to use the lessons learned in this narrow study on the more general scientific programming issues are included. This research is typical of the radically different "reconsiderations" which may lead to better methods for the newer architectures that are becoming available for scientific computing. 0aComputer programming. 0aIntegrators. 0aPower series. 4aMajor computer science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aChilds, S.

This approach permitted the prediction of the interactive residues involved in ligand binding and identification of molecular motifs that might be present in the biological sweet taste receptor. Competitive ligand binding radioimmunoassays, photoaffinity labeling and pH dependent binding experiments, site-directed mutagenesis studies and ligand induced fluorescence quenching experiments were used to determine the affinity, specificity and biophysics of the complexation. Computer-aided modeling using cDNA derived amino acid sequences for the heavy and light chain V regions of the antibodies was used to construct a three-dimensional model of the sweetener binding site. Based on these studies it was predicted that the following residues are involved in complexation: L:96 Tyr, H:33 Trp, H:96 Tyr, and L:32 Tyr form an aromatic box around the cyanophenyl ring, H:50 or H:35 Glu interact with the aryl-nitrogen, H:33 Trp is in contact with the ligand but does not involve a π-π stacking or charge-transfer interaction, and L:27[D] His and H:58 Arg also contact the ligand. Finally, the diphenyl rings of the ligand were predicted to point out of the binding site. X-ray diffraction studies of the Fab-ligand complex with a resolution of 2.2 A confirmed almost all of these predictions. The use of antibodies as a paradigm for the sweet taste receptor may provide insight into the molecular recognition motifs involved in sweet taste. 0aChemoreceptors. 0aMonoclonal antobodies. 0aSite-specific mutagenesis. 0aSweetness (Taste) 4aMajor veterinary microbiology and parasitology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBrown, Wendy,edegree committee member.1 aLinthicum, D.

The objectives of this study were to develop technology for the production of interspecific diploid/tetraploid aggregate chimeras between Meriones unguiculatus (gerbil) and Mus musculus (mouse), and to use that technology to test the hypothesis that Mus musculus tetraploid embryos can support the fetal development of Meriones unguiculatus in the Mus musculus uterus. To develop methodology for the production and transfer of interspecific diploid/tetraploid aggregate chimeras, three areas were evaluated; 1. the use of rabbit antimurine whole serum antibody to immunosurgically isolate the Meriones unguiculatus inner cell mass (ICM), 2. the survival of Meriones unguiculatus blastocysts transferred to Mus musculus recipients and, 3. the implantation rates of Mus musculus tetraploid blastocysts transferred to Mus musculus recipients that were either 2.5 or 3.5 days post coitum (p.c ). The ICM of Meriones unguiculatus blastocysts were isolated by immunosurgery using rabbit antimurine whole serum. Meriones unguiculatus blastocysts did not survive to term in the Mus musculus uterus. Mus musculus tetraploid blastocysts transferred to Mus musculus recipients did not appear to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between recipients that were 2.5 or 3.5 days p.c. However, the implantation rates of those recipients that did contain implantation sites demonstrated a statistically significant (P<0.0005) higher rate of implantation in recipients that were 3.5 days p.c. Using the methodology developed and presented above, Mus musculus tetraploid 4-cell embryos were aggregated with either a Mus musculus or Meriones unguiculatus ICM, cultured 24 hours in vitro and aggregate blastocysts were transferred to 2.5 day p.c. Mus musculus recipients. One Mus musculus term fetus was produced from a diploid/tetraploid aggregate chimera, yet no Meriones unguiculatus term fetuses were produced. The survival of one intraspecific offspring demonstrates the tetraploid embryo's ability to establish and maintain the fetal-maternal interactions. However, the low rate of survival obtained in this study precludes conclusive assessment of the development of interspecific offspring by this procedure. 4aMajor veterinary physiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKraemer, Duane C.,edegree supervisor.1 aDavis, Donald S.,edegree committee member.1 aStott, George G.,edegree committee member.1 aWagner, Gale,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1518980zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744945821&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffse028a9c3-ae15-3d2e-a54f-4125fdb6fc93i18854784-2446-3169-8131-61c4895bae3a04694ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006500109035002000174043001200194049000900206099003200215100003700247245008000284264001000364300004700374336002600421337002800447338002700475500002800502502004100530500001000571504004100581500004000622520247700662650004403139650005903183650006403242650007503306650007003381650005503451651004503506650002903551655002703580700004003607700004503647700005103692700005003743710005803793856007803851856015603929994001204085999007904097in0000097050020200904152533.0910211s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23086570  9AEW4558AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCGdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)23086570  an-us---  aTXAM  a1990aDisser-atationaS5791 aSikorsky, Charles Steven,d1955-10aProduct and process integration for the U.S. design-construction industry / 1c1990.  axvii, 252 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This reinterpretation promises to provide a means to improve the quality and productivity of completed facilities, and improve the competitiveness, both domestically and internationally, of U.S. design-construction firms. The reasons for the decline in competitiveness and productivity in the design-construction industry, various solutions proposed to remedy the decline, and potential solutions available to reverse the decline are reviewed. The relationship between poor quality and declining productivity in the industry is analyzed. Statistical process control (SPC) theory as developed by Shewhart and Deming is reviewed. The most recent quality management theories, quality function deployment (QFD), and Taguchi Methods are reviewed. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of quality in current design-construction processes are developed using techniques from graph theory and Garvin's five definitions of quality. The possibility of utilizing statistical process control theory to improve the productivity of the existing design-construction process is explored. Quality function deployment concepts from manufacturing are rigorously reinterpreted for the design-construction process and a set of axioms which must be satisfied if the design-construction process satisfies all quality function deployment requirements are developed. Using these axioms, the existing design-construction construction process is then evaluated using QFD as a basis of measurement. Also using QFD as a basis of measurement, the relative improvements in quality and productivity to be gained are evaluated if: (a) the recent ASCE quality manual is implemented, (b) constructability is adopted, (c) new safety formats such as the LRFD Code are adopted, and (d) two prominent approaches to human error reduction and control are adopted. In addition to proposing a more robust approach to design and construction, this study also identifies several fundamental weaknesses in U.S. design-construction practices, namely the inability to: (a) accurately determine user requirements; (b) accurately establish target values to reflect these requirements; and (c) accurately transform these target values through design of components, fabrication of components, assembly of subsystems, and writing of specifications to reflect the fabrication and assembly. 0aIndustrial productivityzUnited States. 0aConstruction industryzUnited StatesxQuality control. 0aConstruction industryxProduction standardszUnited States. 7aConstruction industryxProduction standards.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00876110 7aConstruction industryxQuality control.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00876113 7aIndustrial productivity.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00971502 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 4aMajor civil engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStubbs, Norris,edegree supervisor.1 aBerke, Philip,edegree committee member.1 aJohnston, Waymon L.,edegree committee member.1 aSamson, Charles H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1097707zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745089801&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffse45e35a0-a544-3ad1-8087-2d1b87657a52i18e99e8b-a62f-3e6e-85d8-6aed3f0d1ba002781ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002700218245005600245264001000301300004400311336002600355337002800381338002700409500002800436502004100464500001000505504004100515500004300556520102300599650003001622650002501652650001301677650003201690655002701722700004801749700005001797700004401847700004901891710005801940856007801998856015602076994001202232999007902244in0000115509720200904152637.0930917s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm28841416  9AGC7624AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)28841416  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaS5251 aShafi, Muhammad Asjad.10aPrediction of cellular structure in polymer foams / 1c1992.  ax, 139 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The nucleation rate expression is combined with the bubble growth model which takes into account the transport of momentum and mass in the melt. The initial conditions for bubble growth are determined for low values of the Peclet number by taking into account kinetic and transport effects. The concept of expanding influenced volume is introduced to describe simultaneous nucleation and bubble growth. The results indicate that the surface and viscous forces dominate the bubble growth during the early stages while the mass transfer parameters (Peclet and Solubility numbers, dimensionless ambient pressure) limit the growth during the later stages. The ultimate bubble size distribution is affected by the values of these parameters but is most sensitive to the Gibbs number which appears in the exponential term of the nucleation rate equation. 0aPlastic foamsxStructure. 0aPolymersxStructure. 0aBubbles. 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aFlumerfelt, Raymond W.,edegree supervisor.1 aGlover, Charles J.,edegree committee member.1 aLetton, Alan,edegree committee member.1 aSlattery, John C.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1348945zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744913181&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs98c55961-a8d7-3268-b57f-be036f6824bei190bf63a-3c16-3cd2-9b96-a1a503c4924903936ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099003000189100001500219245023400234264001000468300004600478336002600524337002800550338002700578500002800605502004100633500001000674504004100684500003200725520197800757650003202735650002602767650002702793650002302820650002102843655002702864700004202891700005002933700005102983700004903034710005803083856007803141856015603219994001203375999007903387in0000116055720200904152638.0931014s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm29012433  9AGD3277AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)29012433  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaS69861 aSong, Jun.10aElectronic structure and reaction mechanism of transition metal complexes :bbond-stretch isomerism, methane activation on transient cyclopentadienylcarbonylrhodium, and ligand substitutions on metal nitrosyl carbonyl complexes / 1c1992.  axii, 126 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Our calculations at the levels of the restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and configuration interaction provide no evidence for the existence of bond-stretch isomers. For (LWOCl2) + (L=N,N'N''-trimethyl-1,4,7=triazacyclononane complexes, only the 2A' state can be identified as a ground state. The 2A'' is an excited state and the orbital crossing mechanism cannot explain the occurrence of two stable isomers. For cis-mer-MoOCl2(PR3)3 complexes, the second-order Jahn-Teller effect is too weak to cause the bond-stretch phenomenon. Methane oxidative-addition to a transient RhCp(CO) complex involves an agostic-like intermediate in the early stage of the reaction with a metal-CH dative interaction. The transition state shows C-H bond breaking and is stabilized by the Rh-C and Rh-H dative bonding interactions. The second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation calculations predict an exothermic reaction with a reaction energy of 30.6 kcal/mol, an intermediate with a stabilization energy of 14.8 kcal/mol and an activation barrier of 4.1 kcal/mol relative to the intermediate. CO substitution reactions on W(CO)4(NO)Cl and isoelectronic Re(CO)5Cl are examined through the construction of potential surfaces. The RHF calculations for the substitution by PMe3 on W(CO)4NOCl predict an associative mechanism with a 7-coordinate intermediate. The Laplacian of the total charge density displays a process in which electrons shift from the metal to the nitrogen, create an additional N lone pair and vacate a coordinate site for the entering ligand. Substitution by any PR3 on Re(CO)5Cl, however, proceeds by a dissociative or I[d] mechanism since the CO ligand cannot accommodate an additional electron pair. We also explored the influences of both the electron correlation and the basis set superposition error on the potential surfaces. 0aTransition metal complexes. 0aElectronic structure. 0aReactivity (Chemistry) 0aQuantum chemistry. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHall, Michael B.,edegree supervisor.1 aHedges, Richard M.,edegree committee member.1 aLucchese, Robert R.,edegree committee member.1 aWilliams, Glen N.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1354162zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744909691&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs31759d6f-4dd6-3271-b6a3-8b9e5c57d9f1i195479f4-eac5-39e1-80a8-f492435a271103526ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159100002800168245013100196264001000327300004700337336002600384337002800410338002700438504004100465500001000506502004100516500004500557520176400602650003402366655002702400700004002427700004702467700004702514700003902561710005802600856015602658856007802814856013302892994001203025999007903037in0000130057820200904152730.0960515s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34738146  9AHA3049AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34738146  aTXAM1 aKang, Dae-Seong,d1960-10aInvariant pattern recognition system based on sequential color processing and geometrical transformation /cby Dae-Seong Kang. 1c1994.  axiii, 111 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

This research describes the development of an invariant traffic sign recognition system capable of tolerating the above variations. The signs are restricted to three types of warning signs and are all of red color.  The procedure of the developed invariant pattern recognition system consists of three phases: (a) color image segmentation, (b) segmented image refinement, and (c) object recognition. In the color image segmentation phase, the proposed segmentation algorithm uses a partition and merge concept and the (u, v, h)-color coordinate system. A smoothing filter and morphological filters are used to refine the segmented binary image. The proposed smoothing filter is a nonlinear processing technique which is useful for filling little holes and eliminating small spots in an image. A unique combination of a centered polar-exponential grid, a Fourier transform, and a back-propagation network is used in the object recognition phase.  The developed recognition system is insensitive to brightness changes as well as invariant to translation, rotation, scale change, and noise. The architecture of this system is based upon neural network supervised learning after geometrical transformations have been applied. The proposed system is tested on a large number of signs with different positions, rotations, scale changes, and backgrounds. The performance of this system is compared with other invariant recognition approaches in terms of the percentage of correct decisions in outdoor noisy environments. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGriswold, N.C.,edegree supervisor.1 aKehtarnavaz, N.,edegree committee member.1 aGeorghiades, C.,edegree committee member.1 aKim, J.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740896121&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551734zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740896121&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs416f976c-3a90-397c-8b4a-296d42febb9ci1b700323-d09e-317f-b1ef-bd38c43b1a5103992ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040007500109035002000184043001200204049000900216099002900225100003500254245009500289264001000384300004700394336002600441337002800467338002700495500002800522502004100550500001000591504004100601500004000642520195000682650005602632650004002688650002902728655002702757700004202784700005102826700004802877700004502925710005802970856016903028856007803197856015603275994001203431999007903443in0000107326220200904152605.0920304s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm25388500  9AFP3087AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCGdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)25388500  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaS6771 aSobanjo, John Olusegun,d1958-12aA decision support methodology for the rehabilitation and replacement of highway bridges / 1c1991.  axiii, 317 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This need has also been recognized in Texas, necessitating the development of a comprehensive bridge management system (BMS) in Texas, transportation agency. This dissertation presents the results of a study conducted to develop analytical tools required as part of a BMS. First, a preliminary study was conducted to model the deterioration patterns of Texas highway bridges--bridges under the jurisdiction of the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT). The second part of the dissertation discusses the development of a computerized decision support methodology for the evaluation and selection of feasible improvement strategies--maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement - on a bridge. Using the bridge condition data available for Texas bridge on the SDHPT's Bridge Inventory Inspection and Appraisal Program (BRINSAP) computerized database and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)'s records, statistical correlation analyses, regression analyses, and probability models include linear, piecewise-linear, and nonlinear models while the probability analyses resulted in state probability and age probability distribution. In addition, the expert opinions of Texas bridge engineers were elicited and used to formulate linear models of bridge deterioration. Once a bridge deterioration pattern is modeled, it is the possible to predict furfure condition and deficiencies on the bridge. Feasible strategies should be synthesized to correct of at least halt the observed or predicted deterioration of the bridge. To aid the bridge engineer in evaluating and selecting the best of these feasible improvement strategies, a decision support methodology based on a systems approach was formulated, capable of incorporating the expert judgment of bridge engineers... 0aBridgeszTexasxMaintenance and repairxManagement. 0aDecision makingxComputer programs. 4aMajor civil engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStukhart, George,edegree supervisor.1 aFeldman, Richard M.,edegree committee member.1 aHancher, Donn E.,edegree committee member.1 aJames, Ray W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913400541xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1229778zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745163381&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffscf7d6d6a-8ceb-3d81-afc6-f278fc96d373i1cb73fb1-e765-3799-826b-51c0ceee7d5a03901ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003700223245010400260264001000364300004600374336002600420337002800446338002700474500002800501502004100529500001000570504004100580500004500621520186600666650002402532650003602556650003402592650003402626655002702660700004202687700005002729700004802779700005202827710005802879856016902937856007803106856015603184994001203340999007903352in0000100872720200904152535.0910516s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23750606  9AFD6219AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23750606  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS8551 aStienstra, David I.

Current weakest link statistical models predict that cleavage toughness data will follow a two-parameter Weibull distribution with known shape parameter. This dissertation first showed the current models to inadequately describe the data, then revised the model and applied the revised model to the problem of design. Because studies indicated that crack propagation may also be important, the model was revised to include modified weakest link behavior in which the effects of propagation were included. Through the vehicle of statistics, micromechanics were used to predict the macroscopic properties. The revised model successfully predicted the trend toward higher than expected Weibull shape parameters. A three-parameter Weibull distribution was found to be an empirically effective approximation to the model and the data. The revised model was applied to the problems of nuclear pressure vessel design in the transition region, and to the problem of local brittle zones in weldments. A Master Curve was developed that was found to be a useful substitution for or complement to the ASME design curves. It successfully characterizes the distribution of cleavage fracture toughness data in the transition and lower shelf regions aim provides statistical tools for designers. An order statistics approach was developed for small censored data sets for which the master curve method was inappropriate. Predicting the toughness of weldments with local brittle zones was also made more difficult by the breakdown of weakest link assumptions. Results were consistent with model predictions that arrest toughness of the surrounding material plays a major role in the importance of the local brittle zone. 0aFracture mechanics. 0aSteel, StructuralxBrittleness. 0aSteel, StructuralxDuctility. 4aMajor mechanical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAnderson, Ted L.,edegree supervisor.1 aBradley, Walter L.,edegree committee member.1 aRinger, Larry J.,edegree committee member.1 aSchapery, Richard A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910699841xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1163158zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745100451&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs52fb7995-0a54-3315-895a-019fa556d0edi1d358062-5cbe-317c-839c-e1982109a6b604161ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003100223245016100254264001000415300004500425336002600470337002800496338002700524500002800551502004100579500001000620504004100630500003300671520213700704650001602841650002302857650001902880650002202899655002702921700004002948700004802988700005203036700005103088710005803139856016903197856007803366856015603444994001203600999007903612in0000099008020200904152506.0910318s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23261177  9AEY9209AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23261177  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaG5261 aGiroir, Louis Eric,d1961-14aThe comparative fate of T-2 toxin in chickens and ducks, and an investigation of kojic acid's toxicity and its possible synergy with aflatoxin in chickens / 1c1990.  axiv, 89 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

In the metabolism study, a tritiated preparation of the trichothecene mycotoxin T-2 toxin was administered as a single oral dose to 21-day old male broiler (Hubbard x Hubbard) chickens and to the more sensitive male White Pekin ducks. At 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-administration, 3 birds of each species were killed and various tissues were collected, as was excreta at various times after treatment. To determine the amount of radioactivity in the excreta and tissues, samples were subjected to oxygen combustion analysis. There were no major differences between the 2 species in absorption, kinetics, metabolism, tissue retention or excretion of T-2 toxin and its metabolites. The 10-fold difference in toxicological sensitivity to T-2 toxin that exists between these 2 species could not be attributed to differences in the time course of metabolic detoxification or to differences in rates of excretion. To examine the toxicological effects of kojic acid and its possible synergy with aflatoxin, studies of male broiler (Peterson x Hubbard) chickens were conducted over a 21-day period beginning at day of hatch. In the toxicity study, 6 treatments of kojic acid at 0,.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 g kojic acid/kg feed were used to establish a toxic response. In the synergy study, treatments of 0 or 2.5 g kojic acid/kg feed, and 2.5 mg aflatoxin/kg feed were used in a 2 x 2 design. The toxicity of kojic acid was evident only at concentrations greater than 2 g kojic acid/kg feed and was characterized by significant (P <.05) decreases in body weights and colonic temperature, increases in relative organ weights; and various changes in both serum enzyme activities and serum metabolites. Although significant (P <.05) effects of aflatoxin and kojic acid alone were observed in the synergy study, these data did not reveal any toxic synergy existing between the 2 mycotoxins. However, kojic acid did significantly (P <.05) antagonize aflatoxin's deleterious effects upon the mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. 0aMycotoxins. 0aPoultryxDiseases. 0aMycotoxicoses. 4aMajor toxicology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aIvie, G.

These groups are part of an Intermediary Sector of the World Economy that has evolved in scale during the last three hundred years from city to multinational and functions to facilitate infrastructure development. The idea of an Intermediary Sector is supported by documentation from previously unpublished archival material of Thomas H. MacDonald, Head of the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads from 1919 to 1953, and from the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library. International highway development in the early twentieth century is examined to answer the question, 'how does global infrastructure develop?' Documentation shows that international interaction was used to create a model of development for extensive national systems of automotive highways during the early twentieth century. The interaction was accomplished by networking among intermediary organizations to promote national economic integration and to promote national industries and financial services abroad. Further documentation reveals the origins of participating intermediary groups. The groups include chambers of commerce from 1599 to the 1920s, agencies of government that act as liaison to industry and commerce, industrial trade organizations, and groups representing individuals as taxpayers and motorists. Based on this documentation the advancement in scale of planning from city to multinational is defined by the dates of origin for local, national, international, and multinational chambers of commerce. The dissertation is structured around three questions: (1) was there global participation in international highway development; (2) was there a period of syndication of ideas to determine the model of development; (3) what was the underlying process supporting the conceptualization of the model. International interaction began in 1908 with the First International Road Congress. By 1930 about 80 countries were in agreement on user's taxes as a means of supplementing income tax and reducing property taxes... 0aRoadsxInternational cooperation. 0aRoadsxHistory. 0aBoards of trade. 0aAssociations, institutions, etc. 0aWorld politicsy1900-1945. 0aInfrastructure (Economics) 0aInterregional connections and international relations. 4aMajor geography. 7aRoads.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01098511 7aWorld politics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01181381 7a1900-19452fast 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHugill, Peter J.,edegree supervisor.1 aKimber, Clarissa T.,edegree committee member.1 aMaggio, Robert C.,edegree committee member.1 aSchultz, Charles,edegree committee member.1 aWenger, Dennis,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1397352zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746983101&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6042cd27-8902-30e8-87f4-29358dac5cdfi2000d2eb-14cb-3445-a272-b0746a282dff03178ctm a2200397Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072040004400095035002000139100002800159245010500187264001000292300004500302336002600347337002800373338002700401504004100428500001000469502004100479500004500520520150700565650003402072655002802106655004702134700004202181700004202223700004702265700005002312710005802362856015602420856007802576994001202654948003502666999007902701in0000129940120200904152732.0960604s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34870047  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXAdOCLCOdOCLCF  a(OCoLC)348700471 aLee, Joo Hyeong,d1965-12aA novel signal processing algorithm for FFPI and its sensor system application /cby Joo Hyeong Lee. 1c1994.  axi, 124 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Measurement of change in temperature makes use of the frequency chirping of a repetitively pulsed laser to maintain high sensitivity and enable the direction of temperature change to be determined unambiguously. The algorithm can also be directly applied to monitoring of other measurands using appropriate adapters and calibration procedures.  Using the same system configuration, a simple modification of the processing algorithm makes it possible to develop an absolute parameter monitoring system. An approximate starting value can be used instead of an exact one, giving the system more degrees of freedom. Automatic detection of the starting value of the parameter used as a reference point at the beginning of the measurement opens the door to a practical sensor system.  Adding one more sensor to the same system setup provides a simultaneous measurement of temperature and strain. This is done by configuring one sensor to experience only temperature change and the other to experience both temperature and strain changes. The measured strain will be calculated by finding the difference between the two measured values of round-trip phase shift in the interferometers. Depending on the need, appropriate modification of the algorithm can be used for simultaneous measurement of temperature and other parameters of interest. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aTaylor, Henry F.,edegree supervisor.1 aWatson, Karan L.,edegree supervisor.1 aBlake, James N.,edegree committee member.1 aFriesen, Donald K.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326561&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust Copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554714zLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 0 OTHER HOLDINGSffsd9468baa-ddb7-3297-a341-02a0c18589c1i20ec3ec2-6f65-3b10-9291-93759b983e1f04396ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172043001200192049000900204099002900213100002200242245011200264264001000376300003600386336002600422337002800448338002700476500002800503502004100531500001000572504004100582500004900623520218200672650002502854650002402879650003702903650004002940650004102980651004003021650003803061655002703099700004303126700005403169700004903223700005403272710005803326856016903384856007803553856015603631994001203787999007903799in0000100872920200904152525.0910516s1990    xx b     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23750725  9AFD6221AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)23750725  af-et---  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaM5161 aMekonnen, Melaku.10aFactors influencing school dropouts in a sub-Saharan African nation :bperceptions of Ethiopian educators / 1c1990.  axi, 186 leaves :bmaps ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

However, no in-depth inquiry has been conducted in the nation to identify the factors influencing students to leave school before attaining a desirable program of study. This study was, therefore, conducted to identify the primary reasons related to students dropping out of school in Ethiopia. The research is a descriptive survey study. The study examined the perceptions held by Ethiopian educators (teachers, principals, and central office administrators) regarding early school-leavers in the country. Data pertinent to the study was obtained from a sample of 315 national educators attending the 1989 Summer Inservice Programs at Addis Ababa University in Addis Ababa and Kotobe Teachers College at Kotobe. A survey instrument designed for this purpose was used as a means of data gathering. The findings of the study show the following reasons as the top ten factors influencing students to drop out of school in Ethiopia: socio-economic status, providing assistance to parents during seasonal crop harvest, uncertainty of career goals, early marriage, attending to additional home responsibilities, lack of learning interest, influence of large family size, low level of parental education, poor academic achievement, and poor health. Also, the inability to pay school fees, distance of school from home, problems with the language of instruction, pregnancy, irrelevant curriculum, low self-esteem, full-time employment, the impact of single parenting, and addiction to substances have been found to have intermediate effects upon the continued schooling of students. In addition to these factors, the effects of natural disasters, and the policy of conscripting young men into the government military, or the practices employed by the opposing rebel groups in recruiting youth into their guerilla forces, were identified by the study population as some of the most glaring factors leading students to withdraw from school in Ethiopia. 0aEducationzEthiopia. 0aDropoutszEthiopia. 0aDropout behavior, Prediction of. 7aDropouts.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00898363 7aEducation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00902499 7aEthiopia.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01205830 4aMajor educational administration. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBratlien, Maynard,edegree supervisor.1 aChristiansen, James E.,edegree committee member.1 aStark, Stephen L.,edegree committee member.1 aStevenson-Burger, Lynn,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910696841xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1163160zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744838901&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsdd194ad0-1235-351a-abd9-eefa23d77d86i2188a473-61a8-3466-87b3-e282f46ef19503434ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003300223245009200256264001000348300004600358336002600404337002800430338002700458500002800485502004100513500001000554504004100564500004200605520154800647650002502195650002602220650005102246650005202297650002402349655002702373700003802400700004702438700004902485700004702534710005802581856007802639856015602717994001202873999007902885in0000104296820200904152500.0910816s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24241125  9AFG7476AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)24241125  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaA4381 aAllison, David Keith,d1960-14aThe application of channeling to masked ion beam lithography /cby David Keith Allison. 1c1990.  aviii, 78 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The effect of boron, present at a level of ~10²⁰/cm³was also determined. Transmitted angular distributions, for particles of incident energy in the range: 80-180 keV, were measured using a movable silicon surface barrier detector with a resolution of $\sim$3 keV and an acceptance angle of 0.1°. Planar orientations yielded smaller transmitted half-angles than axial orientations without a significant loss in transmitted yield. The half-angles of particles transmitted along planes, unlike axes, were found to vary with azimuthal angle. The best orientation for use in MIBL was determined to be the {110} planar orientation. Half-angles for particles transmitted along this plane, and for particles transmitted along the {100} plane, were smallest for scans perpendicular to the plane; largest, for scans parallel to it. Scans parallel to the plane were similar in width to scans across axes especially at higher energies and were shown, through calculation, to be consistent with the spreading expected for particles undergoing electronic multiple scattering at a reduced electron density. The presence of boron was found to increase the transmitted half-angle by ~10% over the entire energy range. This relatively small improvement in half-angle does not, by itself, warrant the use of undoped films over boron doped films in an MIBL application. 0aChanneling (Physics) 0aIon beam lithography. 7aChanneling (Physics)2fast0(OCoLC)fst00852121 7aIon beam lithography.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978566 4aNuclear Engineering 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHart, Ron R.,edegree supervisor.1 aErnst, David J.,edegree committee member.1 aMcLain, Milton E.,edegree committee member.1 aPoston, John W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1190528zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746152911&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsaf8b414d-b483-32c4-a11c-047d27969bf8i21d535b8-e895-3eef-876e-b8d733aa95ba04083ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072040004400095035002000139100002600159245021200185264001000397300005300407336002600460337002800486338002700514504004100541500001000582502004100592500003500633520219400668650002402862655002802886655004702914700004002961700004703001700004803048700004703096700005003143700005003193710005803243856015603301856007803457994001203535948003503547999007903582in0000130080920200904152731.0960516s1994    xx ab    bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34743508  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXAdOCLCOdOCLCF  a(OCoLC)347435081 aLarson, Kenneth Paul.10aAnnual patterns and predictors of electric energy usage in occupied manufactured housing established through the use of spline, response surface, and stepwise regression techniques /cby Kenneth Paul Larson. 1c1994.  axix, 313 leaves :billustrations ; maps ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Individual spline, or segmented linear regressions on each home provided a unique pattern of usage which includes occupant behavior and measures of building quality for each home. Sixteen mobile homes had no significant pattern of usage; 150 mobile homes showed a significant pattern of electrical usage. Ninety-eight of those had coefficients of determination above 0.70. Comparisons of predicted and actual usage of air-conditioning, heating, and base load of each mobile home are shown.  Data of area, perimeter, value, and age from public records with heating and cooling efficiency, heating and cooling knot temperatures, and base load estimates produced by the spline regressions, such as were used in backward, forward, and step wise regressions. Using aggregate data, the best predictors of annual energy usage in mobile homes in three different usage groups were the crossproduct of a variables defined as heating or cooling efficiency multiplied by a temperature differential value which acknowledges all mobile homes are operated with unique balance, or knot, temperatures and base load. The aggregate models did not need any other variables such as perimeter, value, area or age of the homes to achieve an r-square of 0.95 in a no intercept model. The intercept models achieved a r-square values averaging 0.87. Physical characteristic variables and statistical estimates of knot temperatures and base load were determined to be components of heating and coaling efficiency and base load.  There was a very wide range of usage indicative of a wide range of occupant behavior. None of the mobile homes heating or cooling over a normalized year was 1.5 standard deviation less than the mean. Those mobile homes which used more than 1.5 standard deviation above the mean were identified as the extreme energy usage frontier users. Those mobile homes were larger, more expensive, had poorer efficiency values and much higher base loads, but they used energy at a significantly different rate per square foot of area than the other mobile homes. 4aMajor architecture. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aWoods, Paul K.,edegree supervisor.1 aMacGilvray, Daniel F.,edegree supervisor.1 aBoyer, Lester L.,edegree committee member.1 aEtter, Wayne E.,edegree committee member.1 aGraham, Charles W.,edegree committee member.1 aDegelman, Larry O.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740812371&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust Copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551968zLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 0 OTHER HOLDINGSffs6284fcab-3386-37b2-9ef9-903dc565562ci21f7d77f-347a-34e5-8461-b0f37cbf1bf904309ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099003000180100003400210245011000244264001000354300005200364336002600416337002800442338002700470504004100497500001000538502004100548500005400589520248200643650004303125655002703168700004003195700004303235700004703278700004603325710005803371856015603429856007803585856013303663994001203796999007903808in0000130089220200904152733.0960516s1994    xx ab    bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34744915  9AHA3378AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCGdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34744915  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaP48551 aPeterson, Markus John,d1954-10aFactors limiting population size of the endangered Attwater's prairie chicken /cby Markus John Peterson. 1c1994.  axvi, 148 leaves :billustrations, maps ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) test accepted, yet untested, hypotheses regarding the influence of May and spring precipitation on Attwater's spring breeding numbers; (2) survey parasitism and infectious disease prevalence; and, (3) determine which demographic and reproductive variables most limit Attwater's population growth.  The accepted hypotheses that greater than normal spring (Mar-Jun) or May precipitation leads to decreased Attwater's breeding numbers the following spring, while drought during this period leads to increased numbers, were not supported by the data. However, breeding success could account for breeding numbers the following spring. Analysis of the geographic incidence of prairie grouse helminthic endoparasitism predicted that Attwater's should maintain parasite diversity similar to greater prairie chicken (T. c. pinnatus) in Illinois, Kansas, and Missouri. Although I found no hemoparasites or specific antibody against 7 infectious diseases, evidence of Trichostrongylus tenuis was found in 5 of 6 samples collected from all but 1 Attwater's population. To delineate which life-history stages most limit Attwater's numbers, I tested the hypotheses that Attwater's clutch size, egg hatchability, nesting success, brood survivorship, chick survivorship, and juvenile to adult ratios were less than those of greater prairie chicken. The Attwater's ratio of juveniles per adult, nesting success, and number of chicks per brood prior to brood breakup were substantially less than those typically seen in greater prairie chicken. Simulations predicted Attwater's nesting success, brood survival, and chick survivorship must increase sufficiently to close approximately 85% of the difference between Attwater's and greater prairie chicken values before Attwater's numbers would increase.  Results suggested that cold, humid conditions and the indirect effects of precipitation on Attwater's brood-rearing should be explored. Also, there is a need to determine if T. tenuis leads to decreased productivity in prairie chicken, as it does in other grouse species. Adult sex ratios should be accurately determined for all populations annually, and there is a need to determine why Attwater's nesting and brood-rearing success are comparatively low. Management strategies designed to reverse these conditions should be developed. 4aMajor wildlife and fisheries sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aSilvy, Nova J.,edegree supervisor.1 aGrant, William E.,edegree supervisor.1 aDavis, Donald S.,edegree comittee member.1 aSmeins, Fred E.,edegree comittee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900341&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1552052zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900341&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffscb51cd6c-bbb1-3966-8171-750313edaa3di2254bdbf-bcac-3cba-aab9-7ead319622bf04041ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099003000189100002900219245008900248264001000337300004500347336002600392337002800418338002700446500002800473502004100501500001000542504004100552500004500593520223900638650003002877650002002907650002302927650003402950655002702984700004403011700004803055700005203103700004503155710005803200856007803258856015603336994001203492999007903504in0000111391420200904152605.0930105s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27196971  9AFV6352AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27196971  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaS67731 aSobhani, Massoud,d1958-10aMaximizing allowable disturbances in uncertain, non-minimum phase unstable systems / 1c1991.  axi, 146 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The design technique is based on mapping the time domain constraints into the frequency domain to obtain point-wise constraints on the magnitude and phase of the nominal loop transfer function at each frequency. Once these boundaries are obtained, classical loop shaping realizes an acceptable nominal loop transfer function. To extend the design methodology to NMP and/or unstable systems, the effects of right-half-plane zeros and poles of the system on its feedback properties are studied first. Then, the design methodology is modified to accommodate such systems. For NMP systems, an inner-outer factorization is used to transform the frequency domain design boundaries on the nominal NMP loop transfer function into equivalent bounds on the corresponding MP transfer function. For unstable systems similar difficulties are also noted which in most cases can be dealt with as for the NMP case. Alternatively, prestabilization can be used, which in fact becomes necessary when the system has imaginary-axis poles. Consequently, issues regarding the type of stabilization technique that should be used, the desirable locations for placing the closed loop poles, and the effect of prestabilization on the maximum tolerable size of the step disturbance are addressed. Furthermore, a necessary condition for the existence of a solution is given which is based on transforming the design boundaries on the loop transfer function into equivalent bounds on the sensitivity function. As an application, the problem of controlling the position of a ball rolling on a beam is treated. Finally, a loop shaping algorithm is included. The algorithm is based on converting the loop shaping problem into a parameter identification scheme giving a discrete-time domain transfer function representation of the loop. The resulting pulse transfer function is then transformed back into the continuous-time domain giving an approximate transfer function for the nominal loop. 0aFeedback control systems. 0aControl theory. 0aRobust statistics. 4aMajor mechanical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aJayasuriya, Suhada,edegree supervisor.1 aAlexander, R.

Moench) was examined. Cultivars differing widely in kernel characteristics were: (1) soaked overnight and boiled for 10 min (Soak-Boil or SB) and (2) brought to boiling point, soaked overnight and brought to boil again (Boil-Soak-Boil or BSB). Parboiled grain was dried prior to decortication by abrasive dehulling. Both parboiling procedures significantly increased the yield of decorticated grain while reducing kernel breakage. The BSB process gave significantly higher yields with less brokens that the SB process. Decortication yield of soft endosperm cultivars (P721) was increased by two to three times with parboiling, suggesting that soft, floury cultivars such as high-lysine varieties and soft, brown sorghums (bird resistant types) was converted by parboiling into grain with excellent processing properties. Parboiled, decorticated sorghum produced a light-colored, cooked product with firm, intact kernels, acceptable appearance and aroma. Sensory properties of the cooked, parboiled grain were rated as very acceptable. The parboiled grain required more moisture and longer cooking times to yield a cooked product with tenderness comparable to that of the non-parboiled cooked product. Protein, starch, fiber and ash levels were not significantly changed by parboiling. Crude fat content was reduced by parboiling. The amber colored parboiled kernels were harder, more dense and smaller than the unparboiled grain and had a translucent appearance. Annealing of the starch during the soaking step was indicated by x-ray analysis. The formation of an amylose-lipid complex during parboiling was observed. Brightfield and scanning electron microscopy techniques showed that structure of the starch granules were altered more extensively in the peripheral layers than in the center of the kernel. Protein bodies were swollen by the treatment and the protein matrix seemed to be "fused" or solidified after being transformed to a mobile state by the heating treatment. Parboiling in Mali with local sorghum and millet samples confirmed the improved decortication yields obtained in the laboratory. The process requires low-level technology that is available in villages in sorghum and millet producing areas. No specialized equipment is needed to parboil grain on a village scale. Parboiling may be a practical method by which shelf-stable, processed products from sorghum and millet can be prepared while enhancing decortication yields, especially for soft cultivars. 0aSorghumxProcessing. 0aSorghum as food. 0aSorghumxComposition. 4aMajor food science and technology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aRooney, L.

Plants are an important component of a CELSS because they will provide food for the crew, convert CO2 to O2, and consume waste products. In one CELSS scenario, plants will be grown in a synthetic soil capable of sustaining a controlled release of plant nutrients. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of including clinoptilolite and phosphate rock in the synthetic soil in order to provide the nutrients N, P, K, and Ca. Nitrogen and K were provided through ion exchange from a K- and NH4-saturated clinoptilolite. Phosphorus and Ca were provided by the dissolution of phosphate rock. The research consisted of chemical equilibrium and kinetic experiments using clinoptilolite:phosphate-rock mixtures, and plant-growth experiments using clinoptilolite and phosphate rock as the substrate. Equilibrium experiments indicated that sufficient levels of P, N, and K were present in solution for plant growth. Solution concentrations of nutrients were adjusted by changing the source of phosphate rock, varying the ratio of clinoptilolite to phosphate rock, and varying the Tatio of exchangeable K to exchangeable NH4 within the clinoptilolite. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that changes in solution concentrations of P, N, and K with time were best described by a power-function model, suggesting that dissolution and exchange reactions in the mixtures were probably diffusion controlled. Clinoptilolite increased the rate of phosphate-rock dissolution by adsorbing Ca, thus increasing the Ca concentration gradient, and causing faster diffusion of Ca away from the phosphate-rock surface. The data indicated that clinoptilolite:phosphate-rock mixtures can serve as slow-release sources of P, N, and K Plant-growth experiments with wheat demonstrated that clinoptilolite:phosphate-rock mixtures provided P, N, and K for several harvest periods and would be beneficial components of a synthetic soil. Limestone is needed as an additional component to buffer the pH and supply supplementary Ca. A phosphate rock low in F is also necessary to reduce the risk of excess F. 0aPlantsxNutrition. 0aPlant growing media, Artificial. 0aZeolites. 4aMajor soil science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHossner, Lloyd R.,edegree supervisor.1 aCobb, B.

The following mononuclear compounds have been synthesized and structurally characterized: (Cp)V(tmtaa), V(tmtaa)0, Cr(tmtaa)Cl, W(CO)4(tmtaa), Ru(tmtaa) (PMePh2)2 and Co(tmtaa=0) (02CCH3)2. The electronic delocalization of tmtaa stabilizes the compounds of the early transition metals, V and Cr. On the other hand, the ligand's framework flexibility becomes a stabilizing factor in the other mononuclear species. A number of dinuclear compounds synthesized and structurally characterized in this work are: M2(tmtaa)2 where M = Cr, Mo and Rh, Ru(Htmtaa) (02CCH3)3(PhCCPh) and [Rh2(02CCH3)6] [Rh(tmtaa) (PhCCPh) ]2. These metal-metal bonded systems warranted some in depth study due to their formation, despite the steric repulsions of the macrocyclic ligand. The ability of the ligand to displace the metal out of the Na plane and its flexibility to adjust the saddle shape conformation according to the size of the metal and the other M(tmtaa) fragment served to reduce the potentially severe steric interactions of two metal fragments multiply bonded together. Full details about the synthesis, structure and characterization of the above mono- and dinuclear compounds are given. To illustrate the nature of their structure and bonding, they are often discussed in light of other M(tnrtaa)-type compounds, previously reported in tne literature. 0aTransition metal complexesxSynthesis. 0aTransition metal complexesxStructure. 0aAnnulenes. 0aLigands. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aCotton, F.

Accurate estimates of three-phase relative permeability and capillary pressure functions (flow functions) are necessary to predict reservoir behavior with numerical simulators. Although several methods exist to obtain estimates of three-phase relative permeability functions, they have several assumptions that make their use limited and their results subject to controversy. In this work, a parameter estimation method for simultaneously estimating accurate three-phase relative permeability and capillary pressure functions is presented. This method has few of the assumptions made by other methods. Also, the mathematical model used by the method has more flexibility to represent displacement experiments than the models used by other methods. In the model, core sample heterogeneities can be considered in estimating the flow functions. The method is an extension of a regression based method developed for estimating accurate two-phase flow functions using data from unsteady-state displacement experiments. In situ saturation data, obtained with CT scanning techniques, are also used in the history matching method. This type of data is a great source of information to predict correctly multiphase flow through porous media and to obtain accurate estimates of multiphase flow. To accomplish this work, a simulator of three-phase flow through anisotropic porous media was developed. The simulator can model systems in one, two or three dimensions. The flow functions were represented as functions of two saturations with B-splines due to their great flexibility to represent any smooth function. Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyze the accuracy of the estimated flow functions. To demonstrate the use of the parameter estimation method, results for estimated two-phase flow functions using simulated and experimental data are presented and discussed. In the experimental results, heterogeneities of the sample are considered in estimating the flow functions. Results for estimated three-phase flow functions for a simple simulated displacement experiment are presented to illustrate how the method can be used in this case. Since the estimation procedure requires a great amount of computer work, the Cray supercomputer was used to perform the estimation procedure fast and efficiently. The results obtained show that the parameter estimation method is reliable for obtaining accurate estimates of three-phase flow functions. 0aMultiphase flowxAnalysis. 0aOil reservoir engineeringxSimulation methods. 0aReservoir oil pressurexForecasting. 0aPermeability. 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWatson, A.

The nucleotide sequence of the entire region was determined and all gene products were identified and characterized. Three of the tra cistrons in which amber mutations were available and three previously unidentified (trb) genes were found to be included. These mapped in the order: traC trbI traW traU trbC traN trbE traF. Complementation analyses showed traW to be distal to traC rather than proximal as had been suggested in earlier work. The traW gene was shown to express a 210 amino acid, 23,630 Da protein with a 17-19 amino acid signal sequence. The sequence of traW546 amber mutant DNA contained a C [arrow T change in the Gln codon for amino acid 141. Product analysis in maxicells showed that signal processing was inhibited by ethanol; in its absence, mature TraW (21,618-21,760 Da) was found in periplasmic fractions. Similar experiments showed that the product encoded by traU (330 amino acids; 36,786 Da) and trbC (212 amino acids; 23,433 Da) were also processed to 34,275 Da and 21,226 Da mature proteins that were also located in the periplasm. Mutations affecting these three periplasmic proteins are known to affect both F transfer and piliation properties. The traN product, which encoded a 602 amino acid, 65,714 Da precursor, was also subject to signal processing to a 63,823 Da mature protein. However, TraN, which is involved in stable aggregate formation, was found to be an outer membrane protein. Additional experiments showed that TraN spans the outer membrane and is sensitive to hydrolysis when cells are exposed to protease K. The traN548 amber mutation was found to result from a C [arrow] T transition in the 131st codon (Gln) in the traN sequence. In addition, products encoded by trbI (128 amino acids; 14,132 Da) and trbE (86 amino acids; 9,910 Da) were identified... 0aGenetic transcription. 0aGene repression. 0aPlasmidsxGenetics. 0aProtein engineering. 4aMajor biology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aIppen-Ihler, Karin,edegree supervisor.1 aManson, Michael,edegree supervisor.1 aStruck, Douglas,edegree committee member.1 aWilson, Van,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911827041xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1190583zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746197271&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs598e4d55-46eb-3195-9f57-a12acd8d6909i2609af00-e405-3e14-a2a4-37a3c31c67a902841ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072040004900095035002000144100003000164245008100194264001000275300002900285336002600314337002800340338002700368504004100395500001000436502004100446500004100487520113300528650003001661655002801691655004701719700004301766700005601809700005101865700004901916700004801965710005802013856015602071856007802227994001202305948003502317999007902352in0000129359720200904152731.0960503s1994    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34674241  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdTXAdOCLCOdOCLCF  a(OCoLC)346742411 aKirk, Diane Moore,d1960-10aLandscapes of old age in Walt Whitman's later poetry /cby Diane Moore Kirk. 1c1994.  avii, 220 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

An interdisciplinary approach to his "Song of the Redwood-Tree," "Prayer of Columbus," and "Song of the Exposition" shows that his poems of old age in the New World reflect concerns expressed by his contemporaries. This study compares Whitman's late poetry with texts in environmental reform, gerontology, rhetoric of evolution (from Asa Gray and Charles Darwin), land policy, American history, art history (especially of Thomas Cole and Vincent Van Gogh), and works by Sarah Orne Jewett, Elizabeth Stoddard, and other writers. Paradigms of aging, which Whitman cited, predicted a central peak of full vigor followed by a rapid decrease in ability; however, Whitman wrote poems of sunset, twilight, winter, and midnight that intermingle declarations of old and new to ascribe fertility to late phases. Whitman's later poems invoke a cultural currency that has been little explored in previous analyses, even by those who have encouraged study of the 1870-92 poems. 4aMajor English literature. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aPrice, Kenneth M.,edegree supervisor.1 aO'Keeffe, Katherine O'B.,edegree committee member.1 aOliver, Lawrence J.,edegree committee member.1 aBoenig, Robert E.,edegree committee member.1 aBaker, Robert D.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741281461&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust Copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1548689zLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 0 OTHER HOLDINGSffs2711ab5c-b85e-3ec5-a86b-00e7b4a1d19fi275d60eb-8458-3e20-abca-1574faa180b004271ctm a2200505Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099002800201100002600229245010500255264001000360300004800370336002600418337002800444338002700472500002800499502004100527500001000568504004100578500004900619520222300668650004502891650003802936650002602974650003203000650003803032650004503070651005703115655002703172700004303199700004003242700005003282700005003332710005803382856007803440856015603518994001203674999007903686in0000115513420200904152644.0930922s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm28871396  9AGC7661AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)28871396  aa-kr---  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaY591 aYoo, Jae Yoon,d1956-10aIntegrated forecasting analysis for comprehensive urban planning using vector autoregressive model / 1c1992.  axxiii, 203 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

While many studies have attempted to integrate urban activities using structural models, the time series approach has received little attention. Traditional forecasting approaches, with their highly restricted structural frameworks, reveal an inefficiency in integrating forecasts for urban activities. The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated forecasting model which efficiently captures the dynamic effects and trends of urban development. Recent development of the Vector Autoregressive Representation (VAR) model in the field of economics makes it possible to analyze multi-variate time series data using theoretical intuition. The model is appropriate for an integrated forecasting analysis because of its efficient mode and policy-endogeneity. Although there are countless urban activities, eight was the maximum number of variables to identify the dynamic urban structure because of small degrees of freedom. The chosen variables are: population, factory employment, fiscal deficit, land price index, length of paved road, permitted area of new building construction, area of farmland and forestry, and number of school classrooms. After comparing performances among three alternative VAR models, the Bayesian approach was selected as the most appropriate model for this study. After the forecasting model was obtained, comparison of unconditional forecasts with forecasts conditional upon a policy change, provided the basis to conduct policy analysis. An impulse response function technique was applied to analyze the dynamic response of each endogenous variable to a shock to the system. According to the forecasts in this study, the future of Incheon, Korea is characterized as continuing its explosive pace towards metropolis status. On the other hand, the factory employment and the agricultural land use is decreased during the forecasting period. The results indicate some trade-off relationships between activities. The results also reveal the significant gap between the ideal planned values and the forecasts. 0aCity planningzKorea (South)zInch'ŏn. 0aForecastingxStatistical methods. 0aTime-series analysis. 0aAutoregression (Statistics) 4aMajor urban and regional science. 7aCity planning.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00862177 7aKorea (South)zInchʻŏn.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01410731 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLeatham, David J.,edegree supervisor.1 aPugh, David L.,edegree supervisor.1 aMaurice, Sturge C.,edegree committee member.1 aSweeney, Donald A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1348982zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744920921&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs67dd7592-d08e-3997-99b2-4b1d4a872aaai2811f8e2-05af-30bc-ae42-d026abc49a1904148ctm a2200505Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006500109024001700174035002000191043001200211049000900223099003000232100002600262245003800288264001000326300002900336336002600365337002800391338002700419500002800446502004100474500001000515504004100525500003200566520224900598650003602847650002302883650003902906650002102945650004702966651004503013655002703058700004103085700004303126700004603169700004403215710005803259856007803317856015603395994001203551999007903563in0000111028820200904152554.0921216s1991    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27131802  9AFU9912AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdGBVCPdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA8 aZBWT00499145  a(OCoLC)27131802  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaK49551 aKim, Sun Geun,d1957-10aThree essays in monetary policy / 1c1991.  aviii, 79 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The first essay, entitled "Targeting Nominal Income: Further Results," analyzes the implications of monetary policy rules for the performance of the economy in the context of a simple stochastic macroeconomic model under rational expectations. The goal of this essay is to determine if nominal income targeting continues to provide the optimal response to both demand and supply disturbances in a model employing the Lucas supply curve. Unlike previous results, in a more general model, nominal GNP targeting does not respond optimally to both demand and supply shocks while a fixed money supply rule may be perfectly stabilizing when wages are indexed to unanticipated changes in the price. The second essay, titled "Monetary Policy Games and the Role of Wage Indexation," analyzes the role of wage indexation for the Fed's monetary policy in the context of a policy game. The objective of this essay is to examine the role of wage indexation as a resolution of the credibility problem. Full indexation eliminates not only the Fed's incentive to cheat but also the wage setters' losses when the Fed cheats. In the presence of both demand and supply shocks, indexation is not as powerful as it is in the absence of supply shocks. It does not offset the incentive to cheat, but improves the noncooperative solution. The third essay entitled "Is Increased Wage Flexibility Stabilizing?" is an analysis of the relationship between wage flexibility and output fluctuation in a continuous time model with demand and supply shocks. The major issues in this essay are: If there is a mixed distribution of shocks, how does each shock affect output fluctuation? What is the implication of contract length on the relationship between aggregate shocks and output variability? How are the results changed if workers can choose the optimal indexation parameter? This study tries to answer the questions raised above in a framework in which wage flexibility and output variability are endogenously determined. 0aMonetary policyzUnited States. 0aWage-price policy. 0aWagesxCost-of-living adjustments. 4aMajor economics. 7aMonetary policy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01025230 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHwang, Hae-shin,edegree supervisor.1 aJansen, Dennis W.,edegree supervisor.1 aBlaine, Thomas,edegree committee member.1 aLau, S.

The diurnal and seasonal variations of tropical oceanic rainfall are investigated by using the GPI for the period 19 December 1987 to 31 December 1988 over the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The coefficient of variation is found as a simple function of the mean. Seasonal variations of the coefficient of variation are small except during Northern Hemispheric summer. The time scales of area-averaged rainfall over the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) are longer than those over the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during Northern Hemispheric winter; however, they have almost the same values as those over the ITCZ region during Northern Hemispheric summer. The coefficient of variation over the Pacific ITCZ region is reasonably close to that in the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) region. There are seasonal amplitude variations in the diurnal and semidiurnal cycles. During Northern Hemispheric winter, diurnal and semidiurnal cycle amplitudes are large over the SPCZ region. Power spectrum analysis shows that the SPCZ region has suppressed rainfall at night. Rainfall is enhanced from morning to midafternoon and reaches a maximum between 1400 to 1700 local standard time (LST). During Northern Hemispheric summer, strong diurnal and semidiurnal variations were observed over the ITCZ region. Amplitudes are also large to the north of the ITCZ. The composited diurnal and semidiurnal cycles show a rainfall minimum around midnight and a rainfall maximum at 1500 LST. There is also minor enhancement around 0700 LST. These results are consistent with results over the GATE region. 0aOcean-atmosphere interactionzTropics. 0aRain and rainfallzPacific OceanxDiurnal variations. 0aRain and rainfallzPacific OceanxPeriodicity. 7aOcean-atmosphere interaction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01043612 7aRain and rainfallxDiurnal variations.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01089416 7aRain and rainfallxPeriodicity.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01089426 7aPacific Ocean.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01243528 7aTropics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01240674 4aMajor meteorology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aNorth, Gerald R.,edegree supervisor.1 aBrundidge, Kenneth C.,edegree committee member.1 aDas, Phanindramohan,edegree committee member.1 aNewton, Howard J.,edegree committee member.1 aReid, Robert O.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913390241xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1209801zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747411701&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs70a7d976-1da7-3d2c-8721-760f8df2bca9i28fdf1c7-2316-3459-a893-9685cf9c19a204045ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004400109035002000153049000900173099003000182100003000212245006100242264001000303300004500313336002600358337002800384338002700412500002800439502004100467500001000508504004100518500003300559520229800592650003202890650002502922650003102947650002202978655002703000700004103027700004303068700004603111700004703157710005803204856007803262856015603340994001203496999007903508in0000110745120200904152551.0921123s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27018039  9AFU8942AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27018039  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaH88751 aHueske, Kirby Lyn,d1964-14aThe neurological effects of Solanum dimidiatum in mice / 1c1991.  axi, 117 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

To obtain this information, mice were chosen as the experimental model. Alkaloids contained in this plant are thought to be the toxic principle. Therefore, quantitation of the total glycoalkaloid content was essential. Extensive chemical analysis of the plant was done. Hydrolysis, both in vitro and in vivo, was performed and the compounds isolated and identified. Acute intraperitoneal pilot studies with the isolates were done to ascertain which ones, if any, were toxic. Two ninety-day chronicity studies were performed on the mice, one with a crude extract of the plant and one with pure suspected toxin. In both studies, the mice were observed for indications of neurologic dysfunction. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory potential of S. dimidiatum was also explored to discern if this contributes to the demise of the animal. An ancillary objective was to elucidate any hepatoxicity since diosgenin, an known hepatotoxin, was isolated. The mice dosed with the crude extract (medium and high dosage groups) of Solanum dimidiatum lost a significant amount of weight, suggesting intoxication from the glycoalkaloid. Those given the aglycone, however, did not exhibit gastrointestinal injury. The high and medium dose groups in both chronicity studies had reduced acetylcholinesterase activity, but apparently not severe enough to cause death or the neurologic deficit in question. Neither study resulted in a significant difference in the mice's ability to complete the ataxia assay. The high and medium dose groups in the second chronicity study with solanidine displayed aberrant behavior. This response, which included nervousness, extreme agitation, and episodes of aggressiveness, was dose related. Histopathology of the cerebellums and spinal cords revealed no lesions. In vivo and in vitro hydrolyzed compounds were isolated and identified. Oddly enough, the two systems did not provide identical compounds although the parent compounds were the same, namely the glycoalkaloids solanine and chaconine. Both hydrolysis systems discerned the presence of sapogenins that are potentially toxic. 0aLivestock poisoning plants. 0aSolanumxToxicology. 0aToxicologyxAnimal models. 4aMajor toxicology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBailey, E.

Explanations based on forgetting and elaborative processing both intimate that the additional cognitive activity required during high Cl practice contributes to the emergence of this effect. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the attention demands associated with the two practice conditions by using a dual-task method. The primary task was to learn three key-pressing patterns with three segmental timing requirements for each pattern in either random or blocked practice schedule. In Experiment 1, an auditory stimulus (i.e., high or low tone) was presented unpredictably during the practice trials. Subjects were required to concentrate on the primary task during the acquisition while also monitoring the number of the high tones. The acquisition, which consisted of three blocks of 18 trials on the timing task, was followed by 10-min and 24-hour delayed retention tests. Results showed the typical Cl effect with retention performance being facilitated by the random practice, even though acquisition performance was superior for the blocked practice. Random practice subjects produced more errors on the secondary task, indicating that greater attentional demands were required during random practice. However, a cautious interpretation of these data was necessary because degraded primary task performance was observed for the dual-task condition, compared with the control condition. Experiment 2 attempted to eliminate this problem, but failed to replicate the findings on the secondary task performance. Using a discrete reaction time (RT) probe task in Experiment 3, the findings from Experiment 1 were replicated, as well as eliminating the primary task problem observed in Experiment 1. The data from Experiment 3 are consistent with the predictions from the elaboration view. In Experiment 4, a modified practice condition was employed to directly test the forgetting hypothesis. The results provide support for the contribution of a reconstructive process to random practice. These data are discussed with respect to the contribution of forgetting and elaboration explanations for the Cl effect. 4aMajor kinesiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWright, David L.,edegree supervisor.1 aGabbard, Carl,edegree committee member.1 aShea, Charles H.,edegree committee member.1 aSmith, Steven M.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554742zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741281471&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsc267a30c-b34e-3d61-b510-8808ccab6b95i29cf7491-7483-3998-8070-25512af46a5d03806ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002800218245004000246264001000286300004400296336002600340337002800366338002700394500002800421502004100449500001000490504004100500500003300541520201100574650003802585650004002623650002502663650002202688655002702710700003802737700003902775700004702814700004702861700004502908710005802953856007803011856015603089994001203245999007903257in0000110744420200904152601.0921120s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27006993  9AFU8935AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27006993  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaP9471 aPride, Steven Randolph.10aLinear vibrations of porous media / 1c1991.  ax, 231 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The equations are limited to the case where linear stress/strain relations are adequate for describing the deformation. The idea of the modeling is to allow for the possibility of relative fluid/solid motion and the possibility of a second (slow) compressional wave. By directly volume averaging the balance laws that hold in the solid and fluid phases while accounting for the boundary conditions on the pore walls separating the fluid and solid, Biot's (1956a,b; 1962a,b) equations are obtained. The definitions of the elastic moduli given by Biot and Willis (1957) are also obtained. However, models for the inertial operator controlling the magnitude of relative flow have been considered that were not allowed for by Biot. In modeling this inertial relative-flow operator, Biot limited himself to the case where the pores are modeled as constant-width flow channels. In this work, three generalizations to Biot's relative flow model are treated. First, pores that possess variation in their width are allowed for with the result that less relative-flow is predicted as compared to Biot's model. Second, bumps on the surface of an otherwise smooth and constant-width flow channel are allowed for with the result that if the bump heights are much smaller than the channel widths, then the relative flow inertial operator remains unaffected by the surface roughness. Third, electrokinetic or "streaming potential" forces are allowed for with the result that if the liquid is a low molarity brine (molarities < 10^-3 ) and if the flow channels have small enough widths (< 1 micron) then the relative flow may be reduced by up to 45% compared to Biot's model. Lastly, expressions for the phase velocities, attenuation coefficients and normal-incidence reflection/transmission coefficients are obtained using a displacement/stress-vector formulation of the equations of motion. 0aPorous materialsxFluid dynamics. 0aSeismic wavesxMathematical models. 0aEquations of motion. 4aMajor geophysics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGangi, A.

To that end, I have examined eighty personal experience stories written by fourteen- to sixteen year-olds at both discourse and syntactic levels. I have also examined gender and ethnicity as influences that affect both the structure and theme of these adolescents' stories. I analyzed eighty written personal experience stories, twenty each from black and white boys and girls in junior high and high schools in a mid-sized Central Texas school district. The students were asked to write an in-class, first-draft response-to the prompt, 'tell a story about a frightening experience you have had.' Using models established by linguists, rhetoricians, and psychologists, I examined the stories to answer the following questions: (1) how do these adolescents structure their stories; (2) what clause types do they use to encode story components; and (3) how does gender and ethnicity influence the depiction of self, others, and the world in these adolescents' stories? Findings suggest the following: (1) contrary to claims made in previous research, this group of adolescents constructs fully formed narratives; (2) black and white students, girls and boys alike, encode essential narrative components in a variety of complex syntactic structures, though the girls' stories tend to include more clauses than the boys, and the black boys' stories tend to be short and unelaborated; (3) the black and white girls alike create storyworlds of caring and connection; (4) gender and ethnicity strongly influence the worlds created by these boys, where autonomy and celebration of masculine attributes characterize the world of the white boys, and connectedness and diversity characterize that of the black boys. 0aAdolescencexLanguage. 0aDiscourse analysis, Narrative. 0aSociolinguistics. 4aMajor English. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aJohnstone, Barbara,edegree supervisor.1 aClark, William Bedford,edegree committee member.1 aFlorez-Tighe, Viola,edegree committee member.1 aGibson, Claude L.,edegree committee member.1 aGong, Gwendolyn,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1274301zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744871561&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs8e1d7720-ee01-334f-b3fe-9ae5f93abe3fi2a0808d1-17ce-3e14-a0c2-916033c87f8903605ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002800194100002500222245008600247264001000333300004600343336002600389337002800415338002700443500002800470502004100498500001000539504004100549500004300590520163000633650002302263650002502286650002202311650003202333655002702365700004102392700005102433700005102484700004802535710005802583856016902641856007802810856015602888994001203044999007903056in0000102018320200904152538.0910703s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24024083  9AFE9758AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)24024083  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaY481 aYeu, Taewhan,d1956-10aNew secondary batteries utilizing electronically conductive polypyrrole cathode / 1c1990.  axii, 147 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The first model is used to predict the profiles of electrolyte concentration, charge state, and electrochemical potentials within the thin polypyrrole film during the switching process as functions of applied potential and position. Thus, the detailed mechanisms of charge transport and electrochemical reaction can be understood. Sensitivity analysis is performed for the independent parameters, describing the physical and electrochemical characteristic of a polypyrrole film, to verify their influences on the model performance. The values of the independent parameters are estimated by comparing model predictions with experimental data obtained under similar conditions. The second model is used to predict the profiles of electrolyte concentration, charge state, and electrochemical potentials within the battery system during the charge and discharge processes as functions of time and position. Energy and power densities are estimated from the model predictions and compared with the respective values of existing battery systems. The independent design criteria on the charge and discharge performance of the cell are provided by studying the effects of the design parameters. 0aStorage batteries. 0aConducting polymers. 0aElectrochemistry. 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWhite, Ralph E.,edegree supervisor.1 aAnthony, Rayford G.,edegree committee member.1 aGriffin, Richard B.,edegree committee member.1 aHolste, James C.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911833541xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1174769zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746214061&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs0fb82d9d-60e6-373b-aeb8-057f3b49e29bi2a39c931-e322-3e92-ba33-df4fad88f28203237ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100003300217245007800250264001000328300004600338336002600384337002800410338002700438500002800465502004100493500001000534504004100544500003200585520145300617650002902070650001902099650003802118650002102156655002702177700003702204700005202241700005002293700005302343710005802396856007802454856015602532994001202688999007902700in0000111031820200904152551.0921224s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27174549  9AFU9942AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27174549  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaI671 aIrgens, Leif Henning,d1962-10aPreparative chiral separations on cyclodextrin silica stationary phases / 1c1991.  axxi, 142 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

For this to be possible, methods for separating preparative amounts of the enantiomers must be available. The cyclodextrin silica based stationary phases designed for HPLC are commercially available and offer unique selectivity for a significant number of chiral compounds. However, their use for preparative separations is limited by low chiral selectivity values, low loadability and low efficiency. Currently, because there is insufficient data for making a quantitative comparison between the displacement mode and the elution mode, there is disagreement as to which preparative separation method provides higher production rates and higher per cent recovery of the loaded material. This dissertation describes the development of preparative chromatographic separations in both the displacement mode and the overloaded elution mode for a number of chiral compounds (many of which are of interest to the pharmaceutical community) on three commercially available CD stationary phases. The results of the two methods are compared with regard to production rates and per cent recoveries. It also investigates the differences which exist between the two methods with respect to the purification and collection of the less retained and the more retained enantiomer. 0aEnantiomersxSeparation. 0aCyclodextrins. 0aStationary phase (Chromatography) 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aVigh, Gyula,edegree supervisor.1 aSchweikert, Emile A.,edegree committee member.1 aSoriaga, Manuel P.,edegree committee member.1 aSpielgelman, Clifford,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1277052zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746227911&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs10103846-9e67-3809-9751-9aebbd80eec3i2aba2bc6-a9b6-347e-943c-889d08c4276903381cam a2200433 a 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031010001700072015001400089020001500103035002000118035001400138035001900152035001000171040003200181049001200213060002200225082001600247110007900263245020900342264004000551300004700591336002600638337002500664338002700689490003400716505098400750505091001734504005102644650001302695650002802708655002202736700002502758700002502783700001602808830003502824999000902859999007902868in0000447743320191202143450.0920127s1992    enka     b    101 0 eng d  agb 92006699   aGB92-6699  a3805554052  a(OCoLC)26308867  9AAE7420MS  z(UtOrBLW)15770  a26998  aUKMcUKMdVETdTMVdUtOrBLW  aTMVMc1 4aWD 210bI88 1990o04a616.3982202 aItalian Union Against Obesity.bCongressn(11th :d1990 :cCatania, Italy)10aObesity, basic concepts and clinical aspects :bproceedings of the 11th Congress of the Italian Union Against Obesity, Catania, March 28-31, 1990 /cvolume editors, F.

Population dynamics were described for Sesamia calamistis Hampson and the millet head girdler (MHG), Heliocheilus albipunctella de Joannis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Effects of planting dates on population densities of MSB and MHG were assessed. Life-fertility tables were described for Bracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). MSB was collected from fourteen alternate host plants and was parasitized by a complex of parasite species on millet and seven of the alternate host plants. A model describing interactions between MSB, host plants, and natural enemies is proposed. Mean numbers of surviving MSB in field cages excluding natural enemies were not significantly different from mean numbers of MSB that survived in field cages where natural enemies had access. These results suggest that natural enemies did not control MSB on millet. MSB oviposition was mostly associated with green millet stalks with leaf sheaths, leaf sheaths being the most preferred oviposition sites. Millet grain weight was negatively correlated with numbers of MSB larva holes. Numbers of diapausing MSB larvae and MSB larva holes increased from lower to upper stalk internodes. Many diapausing MSB larvae died during the dry season; however, a substantial number survived due to the stacking of millet stalks. MSB population densities were not reduced by adjusting millet planting dates, but were affected by millet growth stage. Platytelenomus sp. (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) was the most common parasite of MSB on millet. Parasitism of MSB larvae and pupae was rare. S. calamistis was a minor pest of millet in Niger, and was rarely parasitized. MHG population densities were reduced by delaying millet planting dates. Bracon hebetor was the most common parasite of MHG. Life-fertility tables for B. hebetor developing on MHG showed that on the average, mated parasite females lived 24.7 days, oviposited for 22 days, and produced 173.7 adult progeny with a ca. 1:1 sex ratio. The estimated innate capacity of increase (r[c]) and net reproductive rate (R[o]) were 0.26 and 86.5, respectively. The mean generation time was 17 days. 0aMilletsxDiseases and pestszNiger. 0aBorers (Insects)xBiological controlzNiger. 0aParasitic insects. 7aBorers (Insects)xBiological control.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00836635 7aMilletsxDiseases and pests.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01021800 7aNiger.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01205480 4aMajor entomology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGilstrap, Frank E.,edegree supervisor.1 aChristiansen, James E.,edegree committee member.1 aMatis, James H.,edegree committee member.1 aPlapp, Frederick W.,edegree committee member.1 aTeetes, George L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:902729341xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1117094zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747346611&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsa08a08e5-bff0-3562-8caf-359445bb5a67i2d829bdb-c310-332c-bdff-75992df5eb4a03023ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002400197245010100221264001000322300004400332336002600376337002800402338002700430504004100457500001000498502004100508500003900549520125500588650002801843655002701871700004401898700004401942700005301986700004602039710005802085856015602143856007802299856013302377994001202510999007902522in0000129957520200904152733.0960605s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34877538  9AHA6360AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34877538  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaP4261 aPeram, Suresh Babu.10aMIG :ba metaframework for developing User Interface Management Systems /cby Suresh Babu Peram. 1c1994.  aix, 93 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

These technologies have had only a limited success in reducing the programming effort of the user interface developer. Some recent efforts to solve this problem have addressed specific application domains. We provide a novel metaframework called MIG (Meta Interface Generator) which can be used to develop application domain-specific user interface management systems. MIG views the user interface as a set of communicating UI objects which represent the nodes of a UI graph with the edges representing their interrelationships. MIG derives its power and flexibility from the use of attributed graph grammars to specify a domain-specific set of UI objects and structural constraints on the UI graph. The MIG architecture also facilitates the integration of constraint satisfaction systems with the graph grammars which provides declarative features while preserving ease-of-use. MIG provides a visual, rapid prototyping environment for the UI developer. We implemented a prototype based on the MIG framework to demonstrate its capabilities. 4aMajor computer Science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLively, William M.,edegree supervisor.1 aSimmons, Dick,edegree comittee member.1 aNatarajan, Swaminathan,edegree comittee member.1 aDonglass, Barry,edegree comittee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741325221&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554893zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741325221&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs2cd8c8b0-dea7-3512-bba5-355dc1dbbd20i2fffb42e-b877-36d4-9962-1bd235682b0a04241ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004400109035002000153049000900173099002900182100002900211245011500240264001000355300004400365336002600409337002800435338002700463500002800490502004100518500001000559504004100569500003500610650003300645650003900678650002100717650002400738655002700762700004400789700004500833700004800878700004500926710005800971856007801029520242901107856015603536994001203692999007903704in0000112197120200904152600.0930127s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27327506  9AFV8251AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27327506  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaP6161 aPierce, Jennifer,d1962-12aA mouse mammary tumor virus promoter element is composed of sequences near the transcription initiation site / 1c1991.  ax, 164 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Analysis of the promoter using a transient transfection assay has identified several regions that are sensitive to mutation. This approach has certain limitations which can be overcome through the use of an in vitro transcription assay. In an attempt to identify and characterize proteins required for regulating transcription, an in vitro system derived from bovine liver nuclear extract was developed which is capable of transcribing MMTV. The sensitivity of the assay to the mycotoxin α-amanitian confirms that RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcription. Mutations which affect the activity of the promoter in vivo show a comparable decrease in transcription when tested in vitro. One of the mutations, which changes positions -2 to +6, results in a significant drop in activity both in vivo and in vitro. Using electrophoresis mobility shift and DNase I footprinting experiments, a protein is shown to bind to sequences between -12 and +13. This protein has been termed initiation site binding protein (ISBP). Efficient transcription from the MMTV promoter requires binding of ISBP as demonstrated by a competition assay in which an oligonucleotide containing sequences from -16 to +17 was able to inhibit promoter activity in vitro. To further define the bases needed for ISBP binding and activity, 58 plasmids with mutations between -4 and +10 were constructed. These mutant promoters were tested in a mobility shift assay and used as templates in the in vitro transcription reaction. The bases that were the most sensitive to mutation were between +5 and +10. This sequence of 5'-CAGTCC-3' defines the core region for ISBP binding and transcriptional activity. The SV40 late and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) promoters have functionally significant sequences at their start sites that are homologous to the core region defined for ISBP binding. To determine if the protein interacting with the SV40 and DHFR promoters was the same as ISBP, a series of binding competition experiments was performed. The ability of the SV40 and DHFR sequences to affect in vitro transcription from the MMTV promoter was also tested. The results of these experiments suggest that ISBP is a distinct protein from the one(s) that interacts with the SV40 and DHFR promoters.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746228091&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsf99d5780-8b5a-3f53-9781-ee4cf60458fei3036d7fe-b01f-32b6-9139-e0b34d04d1e104076ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003700218245008700255264001000342300004600352336002600398337002800424338002700452500002800479502004100507500001000548504004100558500003200599650002600631650001800657650003800675650002100713655002700734700004100761700004800802700005100850700005100901710005800952856007801010520228301088856015603371994001203527999007903539in0000111669020200904152635.0930225s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27576668  9AFV4782AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27576668  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaS1921 aSampoll Ramirez, Gabriel,d1962-10aDouble coincidence studies of molecular dissociation induced by heavy ion impact / 1c1992.  axix, 191 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

When a diatomic molecule suffers the loss of electrons, it will generally dissociate into ions having considerable amounts of kinetic energy as a result of their mutual Coulomb repulsion. In the present work, experiments designed to examine the yield and kinetic energy distributions associated with different charge division pathways for the dissociation of multicharged CO, N2 and O2 molecular ions were performed. A beam of 96 MeV Ar[^14+] ions was directed through a differentially pumped gas cell containing the molecules of interest into a microchannel plate detector. Dissociation products produced in ionizing collisions were accelerated out of the gas cell by an electric field into a time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometer. Upon reaching the end of the flight tube, the ions were detected by another set of microchannel plates. An acceptable binary dissociation event was one for which both dissociation-product ions were detected. The TOF of the first ion to reach the detector and the time difference between the arrival of the first ion and its partner were recorded on magnetic tape event-by-event so as to maintain their correlation. Separation of the time-difference (Δt) distributions into sets correlated with the charge of the first ion was accomplished by off-line sorting of the event-by-event data. Transformation of the Δt distributions into total kinetic energy distributions (TKED) required a detailed simulation of the ion trajectories in order to construct the response matrix of the spectrometer system. The average total kinetic energies were determined for all the observed dissociation channels and used to calculate the average excitation energies of the parent molecular ions. The TKED of CO[^2+] was in very good agreement with previous measurements obtained in a photoionization study using synchroton radiation. The present measurements indicate that states of higher excitation are populated in ion-molecule collisions. Moreover, the average total kinetic energies were systematically higher than the point-charge Coulomb energies for fully screened ions separated by the equilibrium bond length.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747656701&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd2598360-8def-3f63-bdec-964bed8e5f9fi30d446b3-6cff-3053-86de-b713a588367503251ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099003000168100001800198245012000216264001000336300004700346336002600393337002800419338002700447504004100474500001000515502004100525500003200566500004400598520157500642650002102217655002702238700004702265700004402312700004702356700004302403710005802446856007802504856015602582994001202738999007902750in0000128774220200904152710.0960329s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34491011  9AGX7169AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34491011  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaH87361 aHu, Zhaohong.10aStudy of the interactions between transition metal ions and peptides by 252Cf plasma desorption mass spectrometry / 1c1993.  axvii, 243 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Chapter I provides an overview on the fundamental issues related to and techniques used for studying transition metal ion-peptide/protein complexes. It also reviews different mass spectroscopic techniques used for metal ion-peptide studies. Chapter II delineates the principle of 252Cf-PDMS instrumentation and the sample preparation methods utilized for this dissertation research. In order to study metal ion-peptide complexes with PDMS, it is essential to define the relationship between complex structures identified from PD mass spectra and complexes formed in solution phase. Chapter III includes the studies of the effects of solution conditions on the detection of metal ion-peptide complexes in PDMS. Solution pH is the most important factor for determining the formation of a complex. Reaction time, reactant concentration, and reaction temperature all display distinct influences on PDMS results. It demonstrates that the PDMS results are closely correlated with the complexes pre-formed in aqueous solution. Chapter IV provides ample spectroscopic data on peptides and their metal ion complexes. The metal ion-containing molecular ions observed provide information on numbers of metal ion-binding sites in a peptide and metal ion-affinity of the peptide. By analyzing fragmentation patterns, amino acid residues and functional groups involved in metal ion binding in a peptide can be identified. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMacfarlane, Ronald D.,edegree supervisor.1 aKelly, J.

A nuisance of many existing nonparametric tests is that they depend on a smoothing parameter whose choice can be arbitrary. Two nonparametric tests are proposed that overcome this problem by using data-driven smoothing parameters derived from risk estimation procedures. In the first test the regression function is estimated using a Rogosinski-type Fourier series estimator, and the test statistic is a data-driven smoothing parameter that minimizes an unbiased estimator of the risk in estimating the regression. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is derived and the consistency of the test under fixed and local alternatives is obtained. The second test is one for checking the adequacy of a parametric regression model. The test statistic is the L2 norm of a Fourier series that is fitted to the residuals from the parametric model. The smoothing parameter is obtained by minimizing a risk criterion. When the null model is linear the distribution of the test statistic does not depend on the regression coefficients; while if the null model is nonlinear the distribution of the test statistic m ay depend on the regression parameters. A bootstrap procedure is recommended for this case. The consistency of the test under fixed alternatives is obtained. A simulation study compares the power of the two proposed tests with some existing tests. The power of the L2--based test is studied when different variance estimators are used in the risk criterion and in the test statistic. The two tests are applied to a data set. 0aGoodness-of-fit tests. 0aNonparametric statistics. 0aStatistical hypothesis testing. 4aMajor statistics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHart, Jeffrey D.,edegree supervisor.1 aEubank, Randall L.,edegree committee member.1 aWehrly, Thomas E.,edegree committee member.1 aWichern, Dean W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1448427zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746517041&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs52d2ed22-835c-3716-aa82-a6217de3ab99i3124ebbd-16b1-3b15-afad-8e9dca75be4504001ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003600223245009100259264001000350300004400360336002600404337002800430338002700458504004100485500001000526502004100536500004000577520210500617650003802722650003402760650003802794650003202832650002902864655002702893700004002920700004102960700004903001700005003050700004803100710005803148856007803206856015603284994001203440999007903452in0000122708420200904152705.0950405s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32256636  9AGR9014AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32256636  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG3971 aGeyer, Michelle Walters,d1953-14aThe effects of a knowledge-based system on organizational information input overload / 1c1993.  ax, 149 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Today, our ability to collect and present data outstrips our ability to interpret it. This situation has been called "information input overload" (Miller 1960). Information input overload was first investigated by Miller as the logical opposite of information input deprivation and is now accepted as an everyday occurrence. Information input overload is known to have a deleterious effect on decision makers (Sheridan and Ferrell 1974). These effects include: ignoring further input, delay in making a decision, filtering the data, and giving up (Miller 1960). A knowledge-based system was developed that is not affected by information input overload. The system makes full use of data, knowledge, and other information, extracts the critical decision factors and follows a decision tree to find related pieces of information. The system puts these factors into a form that minimizes the volume of data while presenting a complete picture of the situation to the decision maker. The system was tested against project management and performed equally well in identifying core problem areas. The system performed significantly better than did project management in assigning treatments to these core areas, thus minimizing risk, optimizing use of resources, and enforcing the prescribed protocol. The knowledge-based system also satisfactorily identified areas indirectly affected and performed significantly better than project management in assigning treatments to those areas. In addition, the system provided superior documentation of reasoning and actions to be taken. It also provided a platform for using existing simulation models to aid in strategic decision making, and for a geographic information system to aid tactical performance of recommendations. The system used object-oriented design, expert system techniques, a link to simulation models, and database management in an integrated system to optimize, improve, and ease the decision making process, whether under the effects of information input overload or not. 0aExpert systems (Computer science) 0aAgriculturexData processing. 0aDecision makingxData processing. 0aCottonxDiseases and pests. 4aMajor business analysis. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aFowler, George,edegree supervisor.1 aParadice, David,edegree supervisor.1 aConkling, William,edegree committee member.1 aCourtney, James F.,edegree committee member.1 aJenkins, Omer C.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1472985zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744720021&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd2f31971-84af-36f0-98f8-cb847a22de72i321d4429-1d92-38d6-9ef8-1a1285f7429604270ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160050002500180049000900205099002900214100003400243245013300277264001000410300004600420336002600466337002800492338002700520504004100547500001000588502004100598500004500639520233700684650003503021650003603056650003603092650003403128655002703162700004003189700004203229700004803271700004803319700005003367710005803417856007803475856015603553994001203709999007903721in0000121882720200904152712.0950220s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32022946  9AGR2590AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32022946 4aLB1028.5b.K57 1993a  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaK5521 aKini, Asit Shantharam,d1962-10aEffects of cognitive learning style and verbal and visual presentation modes on concept learning in computer-based instruction / 1c1993.  axii, 219 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The effects of cognitive style differences and different computer-based presentations on concept learning were studied. There were two main objectives. First, to investigate the relationship of two dimensions of cognitive style, Field Independence-Field Dependence (FI-FD) and preferred perceptual mode (Verbal-Visual). Second, to study the main and interactive effects of the two cognitive style dimensions on the performance of individuals on a concept learning task in the context of two presentation formats within a CBI lesson: Text-Only and Text-plus-Animated-Graphics. A secondary objective of this study was to investigate the time spent by individuals on the two lesson formats. A total of 192 undergraduate volunteer subjects participated in an introductory computer-delivered presentation of velocity and acceleration concepts. Independent variables consisted of the two dimensions of cognitive style and the presentation format. The Group Embedded Figures Test and the Verbalizer-Visualizer Questionnaire were used to identify the cognitive style of the individuals. The dependent variable used in the study was a 21-item, multiple choice posttest. The data analysis was conducted in two stages. First, the relationship of the two cognitive style dimensions was established using a correlational study. Further, a multiple regression analysis with the posttest as the criterion and the three independent variables and two-way interactions between them as predictors was conducted. Results of the main objectives indicated that the FI-FD and Verbal-Visual cognitive style dimensions are independent. Also, individuals presented with a lesson format that matched their Verbal/Visual preference did not seem to improve their performance. Finally, there was no main effect of the FI-FD cognitive style on the performance measure indicating that the more FI individuals did not differ significantly in achievement from their less FI peers. A regression analysis conducted with the time spent in lesson as the criterion showed that individuals receiving the Text-plus-Animated-Graphics presentation spent significantly less time in the lesson compared to the Text-Only group. 0aComputer-assisted instruction. 0aCognitive learningxEvaluation. 0aEducation, HigherxMethodology. 4aMajor educational psychology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAsh Michael J.,edegree supervisor.1 aRieber, Lloyd P.,edegree supervisor.1 aGoetz, Ernest T.,edegree committee member.1 aSmith, Steven M.,edegree committee member.1 aZellner, Ronald D.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1467051zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744720091&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs4d1c95b3-2ae3-3fbb-9787-a7bdb13565cbi327b4fc4-0cf6-3887-88b6-40d34de4ecd503807ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006500109024001700174035002000191049000900211099002900220100002400249245015300273264001000426300004500436336002600481337002800507338002700535504004100562500001000603502004100613500003200654520193300686650002702619650004602646650003302692650002102725655002702746700004402773700005002817700004802867700005102915710005802966856007803024856015603102994001203258999007903270in0000122521320200904152657.0950329s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32221215  9AGR8369AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdGBVCPdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA8 aZBWT00803044  a(OCoLC)32221215  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaD8151 aDubofsky, Paulette.14aThe effect of related versus unrelated acquisition-divestiture transactions on the market values of acquiring and divesting firm :ban event study / 1c1993.  aix, 155 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Specifically, the primary research questions to be addressed are: 1. What types of divestitures of business units by a diversified multibusiness firm are perceived favorably by the capital market (i.e., as strategic actions conducive to superior future performance)? 2. What types of acquisitions of business units (divested by another firm) are perceived favorably by the capital market (i.e., as strategic actions conducive to superior future performance)? 3. What effect does the type of relatedness of the divested business unit to the firm's core business (and/or other businesses in the firm's portfolio) have on the change in the market value of the firm? 4. What effect does the type of relatedness of the acquired business unit to the firm's core business (and/or other businesses in the portfolio) have on the change in the market value of the firm? 5. How does relative size of the divested/acquired unit influence the market value of the transaction? An event study methodology is used to examine the relationship between strategy choice (acquisitions and divestitures) and performance. Strategy choice is assessed by classifying the acquisitions and divestitures of business units into related and unrelated categories. The findings support the hypotheses that firms can increase their market value by expanding into product-markets that are related to that firm's core competencies and/or from exiting from product-markets unrelated to those core competencies. The change in market value associated with an unrelated divestiture-related acquisition dyad was found to be greater than the change in market value associated with other dyads examined, with the exception of the unrelated divestiture-unrelated acquisition dyad. 0aCorporate divestiture. 0aConsolidation and merger of corporations. 0aDiversification in industry. 4aMajor marketing. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aVaradarajan, Rajan,edegree supervisor.1 aConant, Jeffrey S.,edegree committee member.1 aJenkins, Omer C.,edegree committee member.1 aSzymanski, David M.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1472404zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744719971&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs83ed8e0a-dff8-382d-8ece-61c87b1fb0e8i32fa7f15-f2f3-3a35-a2f7-ff5d9dd7afc703778ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099002900201100003300230245011500263264001000378300004500388336002600433337002800459338002700487500002800514502004100542500001000583504004100593500003600634520169500670650003002365650003702395650003202432650003902464651005402503650002502557655002702582700004102609700004802650700004402698700004502742700004502787700004502832710005802877856007802935856015603013994001203169999007903181in0000099748020200904152534.0910329s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23354732  9AEZ1751AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)23354732  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS7351 aSpangler, Anne Marie,d1962-10aCalibrating and validating the Texas A & M forage, diet, and sheep simulation models for the Edwards Plateau / 1c1990.  axv, 160 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Field data from three sites, one near Brady and two near Sonora, Texas, were used to validate model output for forage standing crop and quality, diet composition and quality, and sheep intake and production. Simulation experiments were conducted to test the sensitivity of the models to changes in the initial partitioning of leaf and stem and live and dead in forage standing crop and in the palatability, harvestability, and avoidance values of forage pools. Simulated trends for forage dynamics, diet selection, and sheep production generally followed observed patterns for each of the three sites. Forage dynamics were driven by growth and showed greater sensitivity to the division of leaf and stem within the initial standing crop than to the division of live and dead. Diet selection was highly responsive to changes in forage availability. Trends in diet selection closely followed the seasonal growth patterns of warm- and cool-season grasses and forbs. Palatability, harvestability, and avoidance parameters were most sensitive when live biomass was limiting. Avoidance affected the preference of a forage pool, while palatability and harvestability affected intake. Responses to the diet search algorithm suggested a need for more precise measures of the relation between forage availability and intake, and a better understanding of forage dynamics, particularly for forbs. The linked models provide a working hypothesis for evaluating the dynamic interaction between available forage and diet selection. 0aSheepxFeeding and feeds. 0aGrazingzTexaszEdwards Plateau. 0aAnimal-plant relationships. 7aGrazing.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00946979 7aTexaszEdwards Plateau.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01243757 4aMajor range science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKothmann, M.

The flagellar apparatus consists of a functional kinetosome, nonfunctional centriole, anchoring struts, basal mitochondrion, and a root system consisting of a rhizoplast and a microtubular root. This study was undertaken to more clearly understand the relationship between flagellar apparatus structure and function, with emphasis placed on the flagellar root system. The specific aims of this study were: 1) Reconstruct from transmission electron micrographs the structure of the flagellar apparatus. 2) Determine the possible function(s) of the rhizoplast 3) Determine the developmental sequence of the rhizoplast during sporogenesis. 4) Determine whether α-tubulin of the microtubular root is acetylated. The structural observations make it likely that the rhizoplast may allow the flagellum to determine the direction of motility since the rhizoplast is attached directly to the a- and c- tubules of the kinetosome triplets 1, 2, and 9. The rhizoplast also functions to link the single basal mitochondrion to the kinetosome. This establishes an inherent polarity in the cell so that the plane of flagellar beat is always oriented in the same direction with respect to the internal organization of the cell. The rhizoplast may also function to align the flagellar apparatus of the male and female gametes following fusion. The microtubular root is resistant to microtubule depolymerizing drugs. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates the presence of α-1 and α-3 tubulin isoforms in axonemal and flagellar root microtubules, suggesting that both sets of microtubules may exist primarily in an acetylated (α-3) state. This was confirmed by cross reaction of tubulin from axonemes and the microtubular root with antibodies (gift from G. Piperno) directed against acetylated a-tubulin. This acetylation may contribute to the stability of the microtubular root. Development of the rhizoplast occurs after the onset of sporogenesis. The rhizoplast is fully formed immediately prior to cleavage of the sporangium. Evidence is presented that a specific region of the nuclear membrane (nucleus-associated organelle) is instrumental in aligning the kinetosome to the nucleus, associated with the forming rhizoplast, and possibly functions to help orient the basal mitochondrion to the kinetosome. 0aAllomyces macrogynusxPhysiology. 0aFlagella (Microbiology) 0aCellsxMotility. 7aCellsxMotility.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00850268 7aFlagella (Microbiology)2fast0(OCoLC)fst00926920 4aBiology 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAufderheide, Karl J.,edegree supervisor.1 aPommerville, Jeffrey C.,edegree supervisor.1 aBhaskaran, Govindan,edegree committee member.1 aBryant, Vaughn M.,edegree committee member.1 aGriffing, Lawrence R.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1118167zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745089111&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsff5199e1-3075-3412-94e7-80368a7b9b13i339ec062-c06e-341f-8dcd-7fc8135ef24703960ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099003000168100002500198245009900223264001000322300002700332336002600359337002800385338002700413504004100440500001000481502004100491500005000532520234500582650003902927655002702966700004202993700003703035700004803072700004703120710005803167856007803225856015603303994001203459999007903471in0000126753620200904152713.0960307s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34328928  9AGX0433AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34328928  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaL73461 aLin, Kuo-Wei,d1958-10aInvestigation of fat replacement systems for low-fat, precooked, coarse-ground beef products / 1c1993.  axi, 67 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Sensory evaluation showed that coarse-ground patties were harder, denser, more easily fractured and less juicy than flaked or flaked/ground treatments. All treatments were similar in flavor attributes. Patties of coarse-ground treatment had higher cooking and reheating losses and higher shear after reheating than flaked or flaked/ground treatments. Flaked patties had higher yields and improved textural properties; however, they also showed surface "puffing" and an internal air pocket after microwave reheating. The flaking-grinding combination appeared to produce more desirable, low-fat, precooked beef patties with optimum yield and textural properties. Patties containing an alginate/carrageenan combination had higher yield and moisture and lower shear than those containing alginate or carrageenan alone within the same fat levels. Alginate/carrageenan patties containing 5 or 10% fat were comparable in yield, shrinkage, fat retention, shear and water-holding capacity. Alginate appeared to improve texture slightly more than carrageenan, but carrageenan tended to release more free water after cooking and reheating. Patties with 10% fat were generally lower in shear, yield and percentage released free water as compared to their 5% fat counterparts. Low-fat, precooked, ground beef parties containing alginate/carrageenan combination were superior to regular beef patties (20% fat control) regarding yields and textural properties, and should be considered when low-fat beef patties are destined for microwave reheating. The protein-hydrocolloid interactions were characterized in an emulsion containing selected hydrocolloids. Following heating, actin in the carrageenan treatment appeared to increase in molecular size or change in shape but the result was reversed in alginate/carrageenan treatment. Protein net charge did not change in the control or alginate treatment when the temperature increased from 65.6 to 71.1°C. The results suggested that alginate could provide more protective effects to myofibrillar proteins regarding unchanged protein concentrations and stable configuration during heat denaturation. 4aMajor food science and technology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKeeton, Jimmy T.,edegree supervisor.1 aRhee, Ki S.,edegree supervisor.1 aRussell, Leon H.,edegree committee member.1 aSavell, Jeff W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1520548zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744946601&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs98995c18-2b58-3e83-98ce-96db9e4113dei3547a2c6-9055-3a71-ba99-461ff4c0d45c04338ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003100223245011900254264001000373300004700383336002600430337002800456338002700484504004100511500001000552502004100562500004300603520230400646650005702950650004103007650002703048650003203075655002703107700004103134700005203175700005003227700005103277710005803328856016903386856007803555856015603633994001203789999007903801in0000122271420200904152723.0950322s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32186152  9AGR7633AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32186152  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaT4241 aThibaud, Catherine,d1966-10aExperimental study and mathematical modeling of sorption and desorption of volatile organic contaminants on soil / 1c1993.  axiii, 170 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The adsorption isotherms were BET type II isotherms, which indicate multilayer adsorption in the pores. The magnitude of the calculated heats of adsorption confirmed that the adsorption was physical adsorption. It was also shown that adsorption of relatively non-polar organics took place uniformly on the available external surface area whereas water adsorption was much greater probably due to the polar nature of water molecules that allows them access to the internal clay layers and/or capillary condensation. As moisture is always present in the natural soil environment, the effect of humidity on organics' adsorption was assessed by measuring the sorption equilibria of toluene and chlorobenzene at different relative humidity levels. The sorption isotherms at low relative humidity were BET type II isotherms whereas at high relative humidities, they exhibited a type III behavior. In all cases, the presence of humidity reduced the organic uptake on soil. At high relative humidity and low organic relative vapor concentration, there was almost complete suppression of organic adsorption. At high organic relative vapor concentration, there was competitive adsorption of water and organic. The shape of the desorption profile was very much linked to the shape of the adsorption isotherms and showed a two-step behavior. The first step corresponded to the desorption of the multilayers and the second step to the monolayer desorption. This last step was the rate-limiting step for the overall decontamination process. It was shown that using a water-saturated gas stream improved greatly the organic removal rates by accelerating the monolayer desorption. A model was proposed to simulate breakthrough curves and desorption profiles, assuming local equilibrium between the pore gas phase and the solid phase and an axially-dispersed flow pattern. The sensitive parameters of the model were the axial dispersion coefficient and the adsorption equilibrium. The local equilibrium assumption gave good results which proved that there was no slow diffusion necessitating the consideration of a kinetic/retardation term. 0aSoil absorption and adsorptionxMathematical models. 0aSoil pollutionxMathematical models. 0aSoil vapor extraction. 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAkgerman, Aydin,edegree supervisor.1 aAutenrieth, Robin L.,edegree committee member.1 aBukur, Dragomir B.,edegree committee member.1 aHoltzapple, Mark T.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941088641xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1471741zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745770251&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs397b4a06-6f39-3aca-92e6-2ac9126c20d4i3591deef-4b42-3745-a76f-5cf997c919f902870ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072040005600095035002000151100003200171245010500203264001000308300004400318336002600362337002800388338002700416504004100443500001000484502004100494500004500535520091900580650003401499655002801533655004701561700004701608700005101655700005801706700004801764700004901812710005801861856017201919856015302091856007802244994001202322948003502334999007902369in0000130054320200904152731.0960515s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34737863  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXAdOCLCOdOCLCF  a(OCoLC)347378631 aKona, Sudheer Reddy,d1965-10aDevelopment of a vision technology to monitor anomalies in sheet materials /cby Sudheer Reddy Kona. 1c1994.  aix, 77 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The objective of this research is to develop a machine vision technology to monitor sheet material manufacturing processes where 100% inspection is not feasible or cost effective.  A model to represent the anomalies in sheet materials is developed. The total defective area in sheet materials is modeled as a compound Poisson process and a procedure to monitor it is developed based on the normal approximation. Different control charts to monitor the rate of anomalies are compared. A scheme to monitor the location of anomalies in sheet materials is developed based on the most powerful test statistics against the alternatives considered. This scheme is compared with that of using control charts based on omnibus statistics. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aFoster III, Joseph W.,edegree supervisor.1 aGriswold, Norman C.,edegree committee member.1 aFignatiello Jr., Joseph J.,edegree committee member.1 aJohnson, Carroll,edegree committee member.1 aWehrly, Thomas E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.42uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:9432712zLink to OAKTrust Copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900161&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzProQuest, Abstract41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551699zLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 1 OTHER HOLDINGSffsb3a19923-d409-3828-9496-2934bdbdb2adi36d655af-de76-393f-a00a-005bbea4ce6903646ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072040007700095035002000172043001200192100001900204245013800223264001000361300002800371336002600399337002800425338002700453504004100480500001000521502004100531500003300572520148300605650003002088650002802118650003702146650003002183650002202213650005602235650005402291650004902345650005602394651003702450655004702487655002802534700004202562700005002604700005102654700004502705710005802750856007802808856011602886994001203002948003503014999007903049in0000124503420200904152732.0951108s1994    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm33437474  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXAdOCLCOdOCLdOCLCQ  a(OCoLC)33437474  an-us-tx1 aNegy, Charles.10aCoping styles, family dynamics, and prison adjustment :ban investigation of white, black, and Hispanic offenders /cby Charles Negy. 1c1994.  avii, 77 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Further, this study sought to explore ways in which family background and other demographic variables are related to both adjustment and coping preferences. The major findings from this study included the following: For both females (n = 153) and males (n = 27), passive coping styles were significantly related to better psychological adjustment in prison. For females, but not males, active coping styles were also significantly related to adjustment. However, the relationship between passive coping and adjustment was significantly stronger than the relationship between active coping and adjustment for females, suggesting that employing passive coping tactics may be more adaptive while confined to a prison setting. This study also found that the amount of time inmates had served in prison was unrelated to their coping styles and to their adjustment. With respect to ethnic differences, there was no difference found between whites, blacks, and Hispanics regarding their coping styles or family backgrounds. Lastly, for males, but not for females, it was found that inmates having had families of origin that were controlling and discouraged personal autonomy manifested the least adjustment while in prison. Implications of these findings and additional analyses are discussed. 0aAdaptability (Psychology) 0aAdjustment (Psychology) 0aPrisonersxMental healthzTexas. 0aPrison psychologyzTexas. 4aMajor psychology. 7aAdaptability (Psychology)2fast0(OCoLC)fst00796466 7aAdjustment (Psychology)2fast0(OCoLC)fst00796680 7aPrison psychology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01077067 7aPrisonersxMental health.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01077172 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aWoods, Donald J.,edegree supervisor.1 aDavidson, Emily S.,edegree committee member.1 aRholes, Williams S.,edegree committee member.1 aSell, Jane A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1506833zLink to OAKTrust Copy41uhttp://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741325161&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 0 OTHER HOLDINGSffsfc76ff2b-5b84-3469-894b-e85d8c3079a5i372fb60b-170b-3ad6-a9ce-32f474eb29c004413ctm a2200541Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172043001200192049000900204099002900213100003800242245016900280264001000449300002700459336002600486337002800512338002700540500002800567502004100595500001000636504004100646500004900687520200600736650003702742650003302779650001902812650003302831650005202864650005602916650005102972651003703023650003803060655002703098700004503125700005003170700005103220700004803271710005803319856016903377856007803546856015603624994001203780999007903792in0000101660120200904152535.0910806s1990    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24183061  9AFE9826AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)24183061  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS9761 aSwicegood, Miriam Annette,d1950-14aThe effects of metacognitive reading strategy training on the reading performance and student reading analysis strategies of third grade Spanish dominant students / 1c1990.  ax, 150 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Bilingual education programs have been developed for these children which allow for a dual language instructional approach. This dual language approach advocates the use of the student's dominant language to enrich the acquisition of a second language. Cummins (1983), Garcia (1976), and Thonis (1983) have indicated that an instructional focus on the development of dominant language literacy will have a positive impact on second language literacy. However, some educators advocate the premature placement of Spanish dominant children in classrooms where all academic subjects are taught in the second language (English). Robledo & Cortez (1983) and Goldenberg (1987) have documented that this practice sometimes decreases the English reading performance of bilingual Spanish-English children. This condition may occur because cognitive/academic literacy (Cummins, 1983) has not yet been developed. This study attempted to determine if the Spanish and English reading performance of third grade Spanish dominant students would increase following the development of metacognitive reading strategy training in their dominant language. This experimental study was limited to 95 Spanish dominant children enrolled in the Aldine Independent School District. The ITBS English reading test and the La Prueba Spanish reading test were used as a pre and post measures. Improvement in the mean scores of the experimental group following metacognitive intervention indicated improvement in the reading analysis strategies and reading performance of the children. In addition to these measures, the Burk reading interview was used to measure changes in the students' reading strategy usage in Spanish. The results of the data analysis indicated that all children who participated in the study showed improvement in the area of Spanish and English reading performance... 0aReadingxAbility testingzTexas. 0aReading (Elementary)zTexas. 0aMetacognition. 0aEducation, BilingualzTexas. 7aEducation, Bilingual.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00902886 7aReadingxAbility testing.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01090627 7aReading (Elementary)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01090705 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 4aMajor curriculum and instruction. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStenning, Walter F.,edegree supervisor.1 aCarter, William A.,edegree committee member.1 aFlorez-Tighe, Viola,edegree committee member.1 aKracht, James B.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911831541xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1174837zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746147201&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd8fef118-3dc0-3524-b2ca-10fceafa9568i37ad432c-08aa-31ac-b806-07065901616903993ctm a2200445Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100002400223245009100247264001000338300004600348336002600394337002800420338002700448504004100475500001000516502004100526500004400567520204400611650004702655650005802702650003302760655002702793700003802820700004402858700004702902700004602949710005802995856016903053856007803222856015603300994001203456999007903468in0000121661720200904152713.0950410s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32282944  9AGS0862AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32282944  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaL6931 aLiao, Yizhu,d1962-10aWell production performance and well test analysis for hydraulically fractured wells / 1c1993.  axxi, 327 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

This leakoff results in absolute and relative permeability reduction around the fracture. This dissertation summarizes a study of the fracture fluid cleanup behavior and well production performance after a fracture treatment and presents, in more detail, new methods to analyze well test data for hydraulically fractured wells. The research originated from the observation that poor fracture fluid cleanup might help explain disappointing well production performance for certain hydraulically fractured gas wells. We studied both single- and multi- layer gas reservoirs and we identified factors associated with gas production and fracture fluid cleanup in low-permeability, low-pressure reservoirs. We found key factors which dominate fracture fluid cleanup and gas production behavior. We also discuss possible incorrect simplifications for multilayer, anisotropic reservoirs. The major effort in this study was to develop new solutions for finite conductivity fractures including wellbore storage and fracture-face skin damage. The infinite conductivity fracture solution is included as a limiting case. The new solutions are obtained numerically by modeling a general elliptical wellbore in an elliptically-composite reservoir, including the effects of wellbore storage and infinitesimal fracture-face skin. The new solutions agree with analytical solutions. The time span studied (dimensionless time to) was from 10^-8 to 10^5. These new solutions provide new perspectives for finite conductivity fractures with wellbore storage and fracture-face skin. Both pressure and pressure derivatives are presented in type curves. New techniques, which are based on the new solutions, were used to analyze post-fracture welltest data. We could not analyze these data accurately with published solutions. The solution techniques presented here are directly applicable to all elliptical flow problems... 0aHydraulic fracturingxMathematical models. 0aOil wellsxHydraulic fracturingxMathematical models. 4aMajor petroleum engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLee, W.

The major bottle-neck during statistical circuit design is caused by the prohibitive cost of circuit simulation for statistical analysis. The computational burden is reduced by using suitable approximation models of the performance functions of interest. The major emphasis is placed on Design for Quality (DFQ) which aims to minimize the variance of the performances and fulfill all the specifications. This requires more accurate approximation models than would be the case for yield maximization alone. The dissertation is divided into two major sections. The first section deals with the development of the proposed modeling strategies. The major contribution of this dissertation is the development of highly accurate approximation methodologies, which are tailored to individual applications. Three general classes of modeling strategies are developed. The first class is a black-box modeling strategy obtained by combining an interpolation scheme and a self-organizing regression scheme. The second class of methods is applied to improve the accuracy of physically based analytical models (normally preferred by designers and often available, but are usually too simple for statistical analysis) by combining them with a black-box model. The black-box part of the new model is used to provide error correction to the physically based analytical models. The final class of models can statistically characterize large CMOS combinational digital circuits, which, until now, has been beyond the state of the art. The effects of geometric and technological process parameters are included in the solution. The methodology combines analytical/black-box/numerical methods to achieve a high level of statistical accuracy, with speeds of 5 to 6 orders of magnitude faster than circuit simulation (SPICE). For each class, a set of representative examples is used to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy... 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStyblinski, M.

TCDD inhibits the E2-induced secretion of 52-kDa protein in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Initial studies focused on the development of a unique gel staining bioassay for measurement of secreted levels of 52-kDa from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. This assay was extensively used to investigate the antiestrogenic activity of diverse polychlorinated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The results of quantitative structure-activity studies further supported a role for the AhR in mediating inhibition of E2-induced 52-kDa secretion in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that TCDD inhibited E2- induced formation of cytosolic cathepsin-D, cath-D gene transcription and cath-D promoter activity. Subsequent studies demonstrated that E2 regulates cath-D gene transcription through an ER/Spl complex and inhibition of E2-induced gene transcription by TCDD is due to disruption of the ER/Spl complex through a xenobiotic response element which is strategically located between the ER and Spl DNA binding sites. These data suggest a unique mechanism of action for the AhR which acts as a ligand-induced transcription attenuator. This novel mechanism may be involved in TCDD-mediated inhibition of other E2-induced genes. 4aMajor biochemistry. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aSafe, Stephen H.,edegree supervisor.1 aPeterson, David O.,edegree supervisor.1 aKunkel, Gary R.,edegree committee member.1 aGiedroc, David P.,edegree committee member.1 aPhillips, Timothy D.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326481&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust Copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554810zLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 0 OTHER HOLDINGSffsb03a2c10-68b8-3d77-8564-eda4e6df1690i381aa9e2-ce33-3b02-bfcd-cc03b01508a002836ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002600218245008000244264001000324300004600334336002600380337002800406338002700434500002800461502004100489500001000530504004100540500004500581520103200626650002801658650003501686650002101721650003401742655002701776700004801803700005001851700004901901700004501950710005801995856007802053856015602131994001202287999007902299in0000107491720200904152600.0921001s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm26707965  9AFR7126AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)26707965  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaP2941 aPatarasen, Sittiporn.10aSynchronization for optical overlapping pulse-position modulation systems / 1c1991.  axvi, 181 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

OPPM is a modification of PPM allowing overlapping between adjacent pulse-positions (many pulse-positions per pulsewidth). As such, it has a higher transmission rate than PPM for the same pulsewidth duration, while retaining the same advantages that make PPM desirable for direct-detection optical channels, such as low duty-cycle and ease of decoding. In this dissertation the problems of synchronizability and detectability of OPPM sequences as well as the problems of symbol synchronization and frame synchronization and frame synchronization sequence selection are studied. Maximum-likelihood rules are derived as well as suboptimal, easily implemented approximations to the optimal rules. Performances of these rules are verified through computer simulations. Performance upper bounds which respect to each rule are derived and used as a basis for comparison. 0aOptical communications. 0aPulse modulation (Electronics) 0aSynchronization. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGeorghiades, Costas N.,edegree supervisor.1 aLivingston, Jay N.,edegree committee member.1 aNewton, H.

Field emission vacuum microelectronics is one such technology that possesses the potential to overtake the microelectronics industry. However, insufficient research has been conducted on field emission devices to allow for their wide-spread acceptance. This work attempts to further the knowledge base on field emission devices by the exploration of a monolithic three-terminal, field emission device. In particular, an effort is made to characterize the DC performance of such a device based upon several key device parameters: inter-electrode spacings, size and number of emitters. Various sized triodes and arrays of triodes are investigated to explore the idea of current scaling -- an important aspect for a flat-panel display application. Additionally, the effects of pre-test treatment upon device performance are also presented. Suggestions for future work, including possible device modifications to enhance performance, are given. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWeichold, Mark H.,edegree supervisor.1 aAllen, Roland E.,edegree committee member.1 aParker, Donald L.,edegree committee member.1 aWatson, Karan L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554730zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326571&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd056b378-0be9-34be-8021-283bea006e6bi3925d45c-d5fc-363f-9e41-ad98dc54455b03771ctm a2200493Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165043001200185049000900197099002900206100002300235245016400258264001000422300004600432336002600478337002800504338002700532500002800559502004100587500001000628504004100638500004900679650005200728650003000780650006300810651004500873650003700918655002700955700004700982700004901029700005001078700004801128710005801176856016901234856007801403520154901481856015603030994001203186999007903198in0000105724620200904152539.0920207s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm25235971  9AFK4948AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)25235971  an-us---  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaA4661 aAlterkawi, Mezyad.10aLand economic impact of fixed guideway rapid transit systems on urban development in selected metropolitan areas :bthe issue of the price-distance gradients / 1c1991.  axii, 118 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The data is based on ad valorem tax assessment before and after implementation of rapid transit systems. Review of pertinent literature including literature of joint-development projects, indicates that no study has examined the direct impact of transit systems on land values. Five North American fixed-guideway rapid-transit stations were selected for a detailed study. Four were in the METRO Rosslyn Corridor in Arlington, Virginia. The fifth was in Atlanta, Georgia. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system in San Francisco, and the Toronto Metro system in Canada were also examined using previous data. A comprehensive evaluation of the impact of these systems on land values near selected stations was undertaken. The research-evaluation methodology introduced in a similar study by Hoyt (1933) was used in this study. Findings from this study indicate that fixed-guideway, rapid-transit systems have a strong positive impact on land values. Factors other than transit facilities, however, contribute to the increase of property values near the stations. A statistical model using regression techniques was devised to show the pattern of land-value changes near fixed-guideway, rapid-transit stations. Price flexibility of distance ε[fd] concept was also used to measure the percentage change in the price of land with respect to change in land distance from a development area.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747387451&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs3e37717c-25e5-3a61-8af3-8e61e8cda41ai3937dc76-4ec4-340e-a210-88b1d211776b04302ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100002700223245008400250264001000334300004600344336002600390337002800416338002700444500002800471502004100499500001000540504004100550500003900591520228800630650003002918650005602948650003203004650002803036655002703064700003903091700005003130700005003180700005003230710005803280856016903338856007803507856015603585994001203741999007903753in0000102018620200904152532.0910703s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24024140  9AFE9761AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)24024140  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS3291 aSchiavi, Peter,d1948-10aHorizontal fault tolerance in a fully distributed loosely coupled environment / 1c1990.  axii, 338 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

With a central processor, hardware replication is mandatory to continue processing in the face of hardware failures. Otherwise, processing must generally halt for a period of hardware repair. A local area network already contains replicated hardware, along with software to support communications over links connecting the individual nodes. The existence of duplicated hardware, and independent processing ability within each node, allows for a concentration on software support for fault tolerance. Hardware replication can be limited to such areas as network topologies which employ multiple links among the nodes. This research concentrates on software approaches to fault tolerance in a (loosely coupled) network environment. Current approaches are studied. These turn out to emphasize special purpose languages and operating systems designed to allow for transparent distribution of tasks amongst the nodes. The failure scenarios under which faults will be masked varies widely. Specifically, this research develops a set of language and operating system protocols to implement a level of fault tolerance. This Fault Tolerant Monitor (FTM) system is layered above the operating system. Cooperating applications which desire to avail themselves of the fault tolerance services offered by the FTM system advertise themselves to it. Other applications may simultaneously be executing on the network as if the FTM system were not present. The FTM system consists of an FTM module running on each node. These communicate together. Applications are provided with an Intercept Library which is linked into each executable. This defined procedure interface isolates the applications from the FTM system protocols. Services such as node-independent message delivery and restart/relocation of failing applications are offered. An FTM system following the protocols is developed and implemented under UNIX. It is utilized to generate performance statistics, and performance is compared between applications which utilize the FTM services, and those which bypass them. 0aFault-tolerant computing. 0aElectronic data processingxDistributed processing. 0aComputer network protocols. 4aMajor computer science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPooch, Udo W.,edegree supervisor.1 aFriesen, Donald K.,edegree committee member.1 aLively, William M.,edegree committee member.1 aMiller, Jeffrey R.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911830641xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1174772zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746213951&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs205e8a04-ba61-3973-89d9-d9ae8a40ca7ei3984f32a-5256-36aa-b8c0-c16deeafa2e803926ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100002600217245006300243264001000306300002800316336002600344337002800370338002700398500002800425502004100453500001000494504004100504500004400545520215700589650002302746650002902769650003702798650003302835655002702868700004202895700005102937700004702988700005003035710005803085856007803143856015603221994001203377999007903389in0000115512520200904152645.0930921s1992    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm28865496  9AGC7652AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)28865496  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaY951 aYurich, John Michael.14aThe factor structure of the family interaction inventory / 1c1992.  aix, 168 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The FII is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure family interaction on 24 different family constructs. The FII was designed to measure the trans-theoretical aspects of an individual's perceptions of his or her family. The current literature in this area indicates that there are several measures which have taken an eclectic approach to measuring family functioning, but may lack the comprehensiveness, clinical utility, or adequate psychometrics to provide an accurate measure of total family functioning. The development of the this instrument included a review of currently available assessment devices of family functioning and eleven major theoretical orientations of family therapy. Twenty-four separate theoretically relevant family functioning constructs were identified and 253 items measuring those constructs were written. Through various card sort procedures, the item pool was reduced to 120 items measuring 24 separate constructs (five items per construct). A 10-item version of the short form of the Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability Scale was embedded to assess the effects of social desirability on the FII. The FII was administered to 664 undergraduates attending Texas A&M University. A series of Principal Components analysis was used to determine the factor structure underlying the Family Interaction Inventory. The results of the factor analysis indicated that the eleven factor solution emerged as the most readily interpretable and offered eleven potentially meaningful dimensions of family interaction. The eleven constructs were identified as follows: Factor I- Growth/ Adaptation; Factor II-Family Exploitation/ Expectations; Factor III- Triangulation; Factor IV- Family of Origin Patterns; Factor V- Family Affective Boundaries; Factor VI- Social Desirability; Factor VII- Family Flexibility/Control; Factor VIII- Family Scapegoating; Factor IX-Autonomy; Factor X- Cultural Issues; and Factor XI- Trust... 0aFamily assessment. 0aInterpersonal relations. 0aPsychological testsxEvaluation. 4aMajor counseling psychology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKapes, Jerome T.,edegree supervisor.1 aDavenport, Donna S.,edegree committee member.1 aThompson, Bruce,edegree committee member.1 aZellner, Ronald D.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1348973zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745982621&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs8ab35cd4-2fe8-3e32-b7ee-e0865a83b922i39d34751-9e47-377f-b191-1c6be7e6659b03489ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100002800223245007300251264001000324300004700334336002600381337002800407338002700435500002800462502004100490500001000531504004100541500003000582520153900612650004102151650001802192650002602210650002002236655002702256700003902283700005002322700004602372700004902418710005802467856016902525856007802694856015602772994001202928999007902940in0000104331220200904152536.0911125s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24853201  9AFH5382AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)24853201  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaT6291 aTobin, Tammy Christine.10aComparative mapping of the immunoglobulin genes in domestic cattle / 1c1990.  axiii, 122 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

These cells segregate bovine chromosomes while retaining a full complement of the hamster genome. A human IGHG4 probe was used to map the immunoglobulin heavy chain gamma constant region to bovine chromosome 21 (syntenic group U4). FOS, FES, PDGFB, IL1, SCN2A, and MYCN were also mapped to bovine syntenic groups, and uncovered many interesting areas of evolutionary differences between bovine, human and murine syntenic groups. The syntenic assignments also allowed predictions to be made regarding the chromosomal location of the gene markers on human and mouse chromosomes. The probes used for mapping were used to screen cattle of several different breeds for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). It is hoped that the polymorphisms generated by this study will be linked to traits of economic importance, and, as such, can be used in breeding programs. The IGHG4 probe was used to screen a bovine sperm DNA library for homologous sequences. Three clones were isolated, two of which appeared to be identical based on restriction analysis. Restriction maps are reported for the clones. Further analysis of the clones through sequencing, in addition to mapping more markers to the bovine syntenic groups containing the immunoglobulin genes, will add to our knowledge of mammalian genome evolution, and the evolution of the immunoglobulin genes in particular. 0aCattlexImmunologyxGenetic aspects. 0aGene mapping. 0aImmunoglobulin genes. 4aMajor genetics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWomack, James,edegree supervisor.1 aPeterson, David O.,edegree committee member.1 aSkow, Loren C.,edegree committee member.1 aTempleton, Joe W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911831841xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1197477zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746198681&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs1bc5f09f-f239-3dd2-827d-6faa334a5717i3b4da827-6370-31c3-bd6b-2677a95e4f0e03961ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002800209245006500237264001000302300004500312336002600357337002800383338002700411504004100438500001000479502004100489500003900530520217500569650002802744655002702772700004202799700004802841700004902889700004902938710005802987856016903045856007803214856015603292994001203448999007903460in0000127658520200904152727.0960411s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34555917  9AGY1641AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34555917  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaW4311 aWeiss, Jutta-Alexandra.10aUse of human anonymous DNA-segments in bovine gene mapping / 1c1993.  axii, 86 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

This study investigated the usefulness of twenty-two D-segments as heterologous probes in bovine somatic cell mapping as well as genetic mapping. Six D-segments, D5S6, D5S20, D5S39, D10S20, D11S16, and D12S2 hybridized to unique bovine DNA sequences. D5S6, D5S20, and D5S39 were 100% concordant with one another. D10S20 mapped to U26 (BTA26), D11S16 mapped to U19 (BTA15), and D12S2 was assigned to U3 (BTA5). Four of the six D-segments that hybridized to unique bovine DNA sequences showed RFLPs in cattle. Polymorphism information content (PIC) values calculated for RFLPs found in bovine were generally smaller than those published for human. D5S39 showed the highest PIC value (0.25 with Msp I) and was chosen to be used as a genetic marker in a genetic linkage study in cattle. Three HSA5 gene probes, HEXB, HTR1A, and MAP1B were investigated for their potential to be used as genetic markers with D5S39 in a genetic linkage study in cattle. Somatic cell hybrid analyses found these loci to be 100% concordant with D5S39. The three gene probes showed PIC values between 0.16 and 0.37 in bovine and were therefore deemed suitable as genetic markers in cattle. Linkage analysis of D5S39, HEXB, HTR1A, and MAP1B showed all four genes to be closely linked in bovine. The most likely gene order based on the sum of adjacent lods (SAL) ranking method was calculated to be HEXB-D5S39-MAP1B-HTR1A. Linkage between D5S39 and HEXB as well as D5S39 and MAP1B was found to be conserved between human and bovine. Linkage data entered into the International Bovine Linkage Data Base at the University of Queensland, Australia showed D5S39, HEXB, HTR1A, and MAP1B to be linked to microsatellites on BTA15. The usefulness of human anonymous DNA-segments in bovine gene mapping appears to be limited. Only 27% of the D-segments selected hybridized to unique bovine DNA sequences. Mapped D-segments showed less RFLPs with lower PIC values in bovine compared to those reported in human and, therefore, appear to be less useful as markers for genetic linkage analysis in bovine. 4aMajor medical sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWomack, James E.,edegree supervisor.1 aElder, Robert T.,edegree committee member.1 aFicht, Allison R.,edegree committee member.1 aTempleton, Joe W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941090341xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1531360zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745760701&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs264d09b6-d30b-381e-8a62-54805d258c89i3b73c698-7f4d-3275-91d8-90bc42fe370e04752ctm a2200529Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005800109035002000167043001200187049000900199099002900208100003500237245015700272264001000429300004700439336002600486337002800512338002700540500002800567502004100595500001000636504004100646500003500687520257500722650003103297650002203328650002403350650002403374650003903398650004803437651003903485655002703524700004403551700004803595700005103643700004903694700004603743700005003789710005803839856007803897856015603975994001204131999007904143in0000111028520200904152555.0921216s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27131457  9AFU9909AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCAdOCLCFdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27131457  aps-----  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaL5811 aLeonard, John Nicholas,d1955-10aPhysical and geotechnical properties of seafloor sediments from the Vanuatu Collision Zone in the Central New Hebrides Island Arc, South Pacific Ocean / 1c1991.  axiii, 142 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Collision of the twin DEZ ridges with the Vanuatu Island arc complicates subduction in the Central New Hebrides Trench. The North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge (NDR) and Bougainville Guyot appear to clog the trench, uplifting Espiritu Santo Island at a rapid rate and helping to form the NAB, a deep depression of the Pacific plate which traps sediment and ash from the surrounding island volcanoes. Water content and porosity measurements indicate significantly less fluid exists in the Vanuatu accretionary complex than was found by previous drilling in the Barbados and Nankai prisms. This is due in part to sediments being incorporated into the complex from the DEZ which are more coarse-grained, less porous, and more permeable than the pelagic clay-dominated Barbados forearc. Tectonically induced lateral compression is taking place in the collision complex, resulting in pore volume reduction, sediment strengthening, and intense dewatering through fracture permeability. Lower matrix permeabilities in certain sedimentary units appear to channel fluids through thrust faults to more permeable, tectonically fractured lithologies. Sediments in the DEZ are primarily overconsolidated, due to intensive dewatering during the collision process. Geotechnical tests also provide evidence that each ridge of the d'Entrecasteaux zone causes a different style of forearc deformation. The denser NDR is subducting beneath Espiritu Santo and its sediment cover is being sheared off and accreted, while the more buoyant Bougainville Guyot is riding up on the arc and overconsolidating sediments in its path. Underconsolidated sediments and probable excess pore pressures on the flank of the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge are evidence of a "squeegee effect" in front of the ridge as its scrapes material northward while obliquely subducting beneath the Vanuatu Islands. Progressively underconsolidated sediments with depth below the seafloor in the North Aoba Basin attest to rapid deposition as the result of active Quaternary volcanism. Relatively low intergranular permeabilities range from 10^-6 to 10^-8 cm/sec, and vary within lithostratigraphic horizons. Permeability values appear lower in the d'Entrecasteaux Zone than in the North Aoba Basin, possibly due to collision. 0aMarine sedimentszOceania. 0aGeologyzOceania. 0aMarine geotechnics. 4aMajor oceanography. 7aGeology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00940627 7aMarine sediments.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01009957 7aOceania.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01242982 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBryant, William R.,edegree supervisor.1 aDunlap, Wayne A.,edegree committee member.1 aGardner, Wilford D.,edegree committee member.1 aMcCabe, Robert J.,edegree committee member.1 aRezak, Richard,edegree committee member.1 aStokking, Laura B.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1277019zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746243821&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs163e1f69-523f-3562-ba87-40c59ced8ed7i3be8bc7b-5539-3d1e-b1b7-65542bafd68e03011ctm a2200397Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072040004400095035002000139100002600159245011000185264001000295300004500305336002600350337002800376338002700404504004100431500001000472502004100482500004500523520132600568650003401894655002801928655004701956700004502003700005202048700005102100700004402151710005802195856015602253856007802409994001202487948003502499999007902534in0000129948720200904152732.0960605s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34872806  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXAdOCLCOdOCLCF  a(OCoLC)348728061 aLee, Chong Ho,d1956-10aOptimal control limit policy for a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process model /cby Chong Ho Lee. 1c1994.  avii, 77 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

When the deterioration is governed by a Markov process, such a process is known as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, which is a generalization of a completely observable Markov Decision Process. This research investigates a three-state partially observable Markov Decision Process in which only deterioration can occur and for which the only actions possible are to replace or not to replace the machine. The goal of this research is to first prove that a control-limit policy is optimal, and then incorporate such a policy into the policy iteration algorithm given by Sondik, in order to enhance its computational efficiency.  Two conditions are presented which guarantee that the optimal replacement policy can be limited to control-limit policies for the partially observable case. One condition is a slight modification of Derman's first condition, and the other one is the same as Derman's second condition. A solution algorithm which adopts the basic idea of Sondik's policy iteration algorithm is proposed. Finally, computational comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aFeldman, Richard M.,edegree supervisor.1 aGarcia-Diaz, Alberto,edegree committee member.1 aWortman, Martin A.,edegreee committee member.1 aMorgan, Jeff,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326521&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust Copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554802zLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 0 OTHER HOLDINGSffsef0974ff-4049-3c4f-a27d-618e5d38978fi3cdac289-650a-3e43-908c-5fc0c888eeee04607ctm a2200529Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165043001200185049000900197099003200206100003600238245010300274264001000377300004700387336002600434337002800460338002700488500002800515502004100543500001000584504004100594500003500635650004600670650003100716650004000747650006200787650004700849650005600896651004000952650002400992655002701016700003901043700004301082700004601125700004701171710005801218856016901276856007801445520230701523856015603830994001203986999007903998in0000089850320200904152433.0900620s1989    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm21890779  9AEM9382AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)21890779  aa-pk---  aTXAM  a1989aDisser-atationaA3151 aAkhtar, Mohammad Saleem,d1958-10aSoil mineralogy and potassium quantity/intensity relations in three alluvial soils from Pakistan / 1c1989.  axvii, 260 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The Gujranwala profile is the most developed among the three. The field and laboratory observations about the occurrence of argillans are contradicting. In view of the available evidences, the following classification is proposed: (1) Gujranwala, Fine-loamy, mixed, hyperthermic Udic Haplustalf (same as original), (2) Peshawar, Fine-silty, mixed, hyperthermic, Udic Ustochrept, and (3) Lyallpur, Fine-silty, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Camborthid. The sand and silt fractions of these soils contain mica, quartz, and feldspars as dominant minerals. Chlorite, kaolinite and calcite are present as relatively less abundant minerals. The sand and silt contain both di- and trioctahedral mica. Mica particles in the Peshawar profile are smaller and less abundant than in the Gujranwala and Lyallpur soils. The coarse clays are composed of mica, kaolinite, chlorite, and quartz. The fine clays are composed of smectite and mica with small amounts of hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite and kaolinite. The surface horizons contain greater mica contents compared to the subsurface horizons which is attributed to sedimentation of mica through irrigation in the Ap horizon. The Lyallpur and Peshawar soils have lower charge density clays than the Gujranwala soil. The Fe(II) + Mg contents were the highest in the Lyallpur clay and the lowest in the Gujranwala clay. The higher Fe(II) + Mg contents suggest trioctahedral nature of smectite and a high amount of unweathered biotite. The influence of clay content, clay mineral suite, layer charge density, and structural Fe(II) + Mg content on the potassium quantity intensity (Q/I) parameters were investigated in these soils. The Q/I parameters: (1) Equilibrium activity ratio of K (AR[^K]e ), (2) Exchangeable K (ExK[0]), (3) Potassium adsorbed on interlayer and wedge site (ΔK[iw] ) , and (4) Potential buffering capacity of potassium (PBC[^K]) were determined. Pair-wise correlation analysis indicated that AR[^K]e was negatively correlated with concentration of both coarse and fine clay size smectite in the soil and positively correlated with structural Fe(II) + Mg contents of the coarse clays. The quantity of exchangeable K (ExK[0]) showed a reverse trend...41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745034641&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd2aefd17-4d2d-305a-9e41-2a562ef5fa12i3d767109-8540-39c7-a50b-8c9f6af0fcfc03973ctm a2200397Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099003000168100002800198245009700226264001000323300004700333336002600380337002800406338002700434504004100461500001000502502004100512500003200553520236800585650002102953655002702974700002603001700003203027710005803059856015603117856007803273856013303351994001203484999007903496in0000129832320200904152729.0960513s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34713699  9AHA1588AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34713699  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaD48831 aDevagupta, Rama,d1963-10aStudies on the biosynthesis of indole alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus /cby Rama Devagupta. 1c1994.  axvii, 198 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Out of the 90 alkaloids which have been isolated and characterized, vinblastine and vincristine (bis-indoles) are of great clinical importance due to their anti-tumor activity. A better understanding ofthe various enzyme catalyzed steps in the biosynthetic pathways is important because of the extremely low yields in chemical syntheses and very low availability of these alkaloids from the plant.  This dissertation has focussed on the first two steps of the indole alkaloid pathway--(a) the stereospecific condensation of tryptamine and secologanin which leads to the formation of 3($\alpha$)-S strictosidine, which is catalyzed by strictosidine synthase, and (b) the hydrolysis of strictosidine by a $\beta$-glucosidase to form cathenamine.  An oligonucleotide probe derived from the sequence of the Rauvolfia serpentina strictosidine synthase gene was used to probe a Catharanthus roseus cDNA library in $\lambda$gt11. The nucleotide sequence of the C. roseus strictosidine synthase gene was determined and analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences revealed an 80% identity between the two species.  The strictosidine synthase gene was cloned into an E. coli inducible vector, pHN1+ and induction of the gene resulted in overexpression of the enzyme which accumulated mainly as insoluble inclusion bodies. Denaturation and refolding of the insoluble protein resulted in the ability to purify up to 28 mg of active enzyme from a single liter of cell culture (specific activity = 30 nkat/mg).  It was demonstrated that hydrolysis of strictosidine in C. roseus takes place by a strictosidine-specific glucosidase and a second enzyme known as cathenamine synthase is required for the stereospecific formation of cathenamine. Absence of the second enzyme leads to a mixture of cathenamine and 19-epicathenamine formed by chemical cyclization.  Various 1D and 2D NMR techniques were used for the complete $\sp1$H and $\sp{13}$C assignments and structure elucidation of new addition products of cathenamine.  The complete $\sp1$H and $\sp{13}$c assignment and conformational analysis of strictosidine and strictosidine lactam has been carried out and the chemical shift values for strictosidine lactam tetera-acetate reassigned. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 a,edegree supervisor.1 a,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741037961&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1550385zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741037961&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs6a9eb05f-4771-3b34-9439-c7d182f1742di3e52d058-0dc8-302a-8dab-c72f595a75ec04106ctm a2200433Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099003000180100002200210245013500232264001000367300004300377336002600420337002800446338002700474504004100501500001000542502004100552500003900593520223500632650002802867655002702895700003902922700004302961700005103004700004903055700005203104710005803156856015603214856007803370856013303448994001203581999007903593in0000130082620200904152733.0960516s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34743610  9AHA3310AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34743610  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaP37741 aPei, Luqi,d1956-10aAntagonism of organophosphorus intoxications with resealed erythrocytes containing organophosphorus acid anhydrase /cby Luqi Pei. 1c1994.  ax, 81 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

This was accomplished by the use of resealed carrier erythrocytes (CRBC) containing a recombinant enzyme derived from Flavobacterium and expressed in Escherichia coli. The mechanism of the CRBC apparently was to degrade the OPs absorbed into the blood before it can exert its systemic toxic effect.  Since there were no methods reported to determine organophosphorus acid (OPA) anhydrase activity in blood, it was necessary to develop a method as hemoglobin interfered with all spectrophotometric determinations. This was accomplished by extracting the reaction products, 4-nitrophenol with dichloromethane and determining 4-nitrophenol after extraction colorimetrically. Subsequently a more convenient continuous method without solvent extraction was developed which permitted conducting kinetic studies on this enzyme.  Enzyme from cultured E. coli cells was isolated and purified over 1600 folds. The purified OPA anhydrase was successfully encapsulated within carrier erythrocytes by hypotonic dialysis. Enzymatic characteristics of the encapsulated OPA anhydrase were investigated. As diffusing through the cell membrane, paraoxon was readily degraded by the entrapped enzyme within CRBC. This enzyme apparently followed Michaelis-Menton kinetics.  When these CRBCs were incubated with paraoxon, diethylphosphate and 4-nitrophenol formed rapidly indicating these cells could rapidly degrade paraoxon. These resealed erythrocytes then were administered to mice and they were found to be extremely effective in antagonizing the lethal effect of paraoxon. These CRBCs were much more effective than the classic antidotal combination of atropine and pralidoxime (2-PAM). Moreover, these cells actually destroy the OP, whereas atropine and 2-PAM do not. The CRBCs provided a striking massive synergistic protective effect to the lethal effect of paraoxon. Animals receiving the combinational treatment of CRBC, atropine and 2-PAM can be protected against well over 1,000 LD50 doses of paraoxon. This combination of CRBC, atropine and pralidoxime is far more efficacious than any OP antidotal system ever reported. 4aMajor medical sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWay, James L.,edegree supervisor.1 aHo, Ing-Kang,edegree comittee member.1 aPhillips, Timothy D.,edegree comittee member.1 aThompson, David C.,edegree comittee member.1 aTrzeciakowski, Jerome,edegree comittee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740896431&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551985zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740896431&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs2f15cce5-af33-3bc1-904d-6d8f04b2305fi3f297adf-c993-3233-a5af-d9d95e8692c803679ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003700218245006700255264001000322300004400332336002600376337002800402338002700430500002800457502004100485500001000526504004100536500004500577520185400622650004102476650002102517650003402538655002702572700004302599700004802642700005002690700005102740700004702791710005802838856007802896856015602974994001203130999007903142in0000112197420200904152607.0930127s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27327771  9AFV8254AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27327771  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaV7121 aVillalobos Cano, J.

The tightening of product tolerances and the application of computer technology to almost every aspect of manufacturing are some of the changes that affect the role that inspection has on quality output. Due to the tightening of tolerances, manufacturing processes are not capable of rendering an adequate quality level. As a result, screening inspection as a means of guaranteeing quality levels is commonplace in today's manufacturing environment. An example of new computer technologies is Automated Visual Inspection (AVI). AVI has taken the place of an inspector in deciding whether or not a part is manufactured according to specifications. These new technologies make possible a new inspection concept known as Flexible Inspection System (FIS). Such a system uses the historical information provided by the inspection operations of a single unit in order to select an inspection routine to be used at the current inspection station and to decide whether to scrap the unit under inspection in order to optimize a global objective. The development of an FIS model applied to a serial multi-stage production system and single inspection station is the objective of this dissertation. In the modelled system, the inspection may yield type I and II errors. These characteristics together with some independence assumptions, allow the quality of the unit under manufacture to be modelled as a partially observable Markov process. Thus, the inspection allocation becomes a special case of optimal control of a partially observable Markov process under time constraints where the quality of the unit under observation is a discrete time continuous state Markov process. Time constraints are introduced to account for the limited time available for inspection allocation. 0aManufacturing processesxAutomation. 0aQuality control. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aFoster, Joseph W.,edegree supervisor.1 aDisney, Ralph L.,edegree committee member.1 aHocking, Ronald H.,edegree committee member.1 aJohnson, Carroll W.,edegree committee member.1 aWortman, Martin,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1284231zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746244051&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs05f60a54-20d7-3628-966b-4d573de16615i3f2daa78-f55a-3e57-802d-724adf03a48a03261ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003500223245006200258264001000320300004400330336002600374337002800400338002700428504004100455500001000496502004100506500003400547520137800581650001601959650001001975650003201985650002302017655002702040700004202067700004702109700005002156700004502206710005802251856016902309856007802478856015602556994001202712999007902724in0000121662820200904152705.0950410s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32282901  9AGS0873AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32282901  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG3391 aGentry, Vickie Stevens,d1953-10aFoot preference behavior :ba developmental perspective / 1c1993.  ax, 106 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Foot (and hand) preference behaviors were assessed in a sample of 956 subjects who represented age groups of 4 -, 8 -, 11-, 13-, 16-, and 20-years. Frequency data analyses indicated that across all age-groups, right-footed and right-handed preferences were predominant. Of interest, however, was that incidences of right-footedness were always lower than that of right-handedness, and incidences of mixed-footedness were greater than that of mixed-handedness. Gender differences in foot and hand preference behaviors were not evident (p < .05). Significant (p < .001) age-related differences were found in foot, but not hand, preference behaviors. Post hoc analyses revealed that 4- and 8-year olds were less right-footed than that of the older age groups. It was concluded that when compared to handedness, foot preference behaviors are more likely to follow a variant pattern of development. Of the existing models of hemispheric specialization, Annett's right-shift hypothesis seems to be the most congruent for the results obtained in this study. Annett's model suggests that the direction (right, mixed, left) of foot preference is genetically determined, yet cultural/environmental factors may affect the degree (strength) of preference. 0aLaterality. 0aFoot. 0aLeft- and right-handedness. 4aMajor kinesiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGabbard, Carl P.,edegree supervisor.1 aAsh, Michael J.,edegree committee member.1 aChevrette, John M.,edegree committee member.1 aTolson, Homer,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932872341xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1474649zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747668011&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs242863e3-2f37-307c-a105-37df88ef713ei41aea344-1415-322d-ae9e-dab6d6575fae04261ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003500218245008200253264001000335300004500345336002600390337002800416338002700444504004100471500001000512502004100522500004900563520229000612650003302902650003002935650002302965650005002988650003803038650005303076655006203129655002703191700004003218700004303258700004803301700004703349710005803396856007803454856015603532994001203688999007903700in0000124721120200904152648.0951020s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm33338233  9AGV1571AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)33338233  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaA4681 aAltieri, Jennifer Lynn,d1964-13aAn examination of the role of culture in the transaction of reader and text / 1c1993.  aix, 114 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Subjects included 122 fifth-grade students and 126 seventh-grade students in the same rural school district. Each subject listened to six short stories representing African-American, Hispanic, and White cultural groups. After listening to each story, subjects wrote a free response and then rated the story. Overall the level of aesthetic involvement was not significantly influenced by the culture of student or text. Students from all cultural groups tended to go beyond simply retelling story events and showed evidence of responding aesthetically to the stories by mentioning specific parts, making judgements, reflecting on the story world, relating something in the story to the real world, and drawing inferences. Analysis of the focuses revealed grade level differences with a decrease at the seventh-grade level of responses focusing on the story world and an increase in making judgements. Only the focus which dealt with reflecting on the story world revealed a significant relationship between culture of student and text. With respect to preference, results revealed that a significant interaction was evident for grade by story ethnicity. Fifth graders strongly preferred White stories, while seventh-grade students preferred stories containing African-American characters. There was also a significant interaction for student ethnicity by story ethnicity. Students of minority cultures strongly preferred stories portraying their own culture while White students, although they preferred White stories, were more homogeneous in their preference. Book was also a significant main effect. Implications of this study are that although students of different ethnicities prefer stories reflecting their own culture, they are able to have complex aesthetic transactions to works regardless of the culture portrayed. This supports the integration of multicultural literature into the curriculum because literature affords all students opportunities for rich experiences with literature and allows students of differing ethnicities to enjoy the books reflecting their own cultural heritage. 0aEthnic groups in literature. 0aMinorities in literature. 0aReading interests. 0aChildren's literaturexHistory and criticism. 4aMajor curriculum and instruction. 7aChildren's literature.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01759351 7aCriticism, interpretation, etc.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411635 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMany, Joyce E.,edegree supervisor.1 aWiseman, Donna L.,edegree supervisor.1 aNorton, Donna E.,edegree committee member.1 aWillson, Victor,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1502946zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744716031&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsf937304c-ad8e-3e08-83b6-2ed65839d538i41d4d962-d439-3f32-81bd-aa8998c7337d04556ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002200197245012100219264001000340300004700350336002600397337002800423338002700451504004100478500001000519502004100529500004500570520276800615650003403383655002703417700004503444700004903489700003803538700004203576710005803618856015603676856007803832856013303910994001204043999007904055in0000130060020200904152730.0960515s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34738283  9AHA3073AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34738283  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaJ8141 aJoo, Giho,d1962-10aDevelopment and analysis of a hybrid random/token access protocol for high speed local area networks /cby Giho Joo. 1c1994.  axiii, 145 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

We make use of a unidirectional dual bus as the network topology and develop a medium access control (MAC) layer that is a hybrid of random access and implicit token passing schemes. Due to its hybrid nature, the proposed MAC eliminates the single station throughput problem of token passing protocols, while it retains high utilization under heavy loading.  We describe the proposed medium access control in detail using state transition diagrams and discuss implementation aspects of the MAC. We then investigate performance of the proposed system via both analytic evaluation and Monte Carlo simulation. The maximum channel utilization and an upper bound on the access are obtained under a heavy load assumption. An approximate analytic model of the proposed system under light to medium loading is developed, and the channel utilization and the average access delay are obtained using a Laplace transform method. Although the analytic model is based on several unrealistic assumptions, it appears to retain the basic characteristics of the proposed system. The performance characteristics of the proposed system are investigated and compared to those of Expressnet via simulations. Unlike other hybrid systems where performance rapidly degrades as load increases, the proposed system outperforms Expressnet over a wide range of loads. It is also shown that the proposed system provides more bandwidth to stations performing file transfers when compared to Expressnet. For instance, under the proposed system, five clustered file transfer stations achieve a channel utilization of 0.75 whereas they achieve only 0.53 under Expressnet. We consider three methods which improve the utilization-delay performance, namely, channel selection, packet removal at the regenerating station, and two-way token passing under heavy loading.  The proposed system is extended to support integrated traffic more effectively. To do this, a priority scheme is incorporated into the proposed MAC with minor modifications. The maximum number of isosynchronous sources satisfying a delay bound and the minimum guaranteed bandwidth allowed to asynchronous sources are derived. The priority scheme of the proposed system is compared to those of Expresssnet and FDDI via simulations for the integration of voice and data traffic. It is shown that the proposed system has a larger voice capacity than Expressnet and it is more flexible in assigning bandwidth to data stations than FDDI. For instance, the voice capacity of Expressnet is only 38% of that of the proposed system when the maximum allowable delay for the speech sample is 10 ms. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aCantrell, Pierce E.,edegree supervisor.1 aAbu-Amara, Hosame,edegree committee member.1 aLu, Mi,edegree committee member.1 aKim, Junguk,edegree commitee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740896111&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551756zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740896111&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffsefa1fb24-71ee-3dd2-bae1-b37868b237d3i42432cff-dc01-3562-b1cb-e838eb3b9e0703848ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099003000189100003600219245006900255264001000324300004700334336002600381337002800407338002700435504004100462500001000503502004100513500003500554520198700589650002302576650003302599650002302632650001202655650002402667655002702691700003902718700003702757700005202794700004502846700004502891700004702936710005802983856007803041856015603119994001203275999007903287in0000121231620200904152621.0941122s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31499619  9AGP3270AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31499619  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaH85131 aHoward, Matthew Kendall,d1952-10aFlow over a shelf-submarine canyon system :ba numerical study / 1c1992.  axiii, 117 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Three canyon shapes were employed: a slot, a slot with exponential slope, and a depression with Gaussian cross-sections. The canyon width relative to the first baroclinic deformation radius was varied to see if a narrow canyon influences the flow less than a wide one. The models were forced using a geostrophically-balanced jet, oriented northward, normal to the canyon's principal axis. Simulations ranging in length from 30 to 50 days were made. The response has phases which are best classified according to time-scales. The initial response occurs within 2 inertial periods. During this phase the jet reacts strongly to the canyon by deflecting in a direction consistent with the notions of conservation of vorticity and contour following flow. A double Kelvin wave (DKW) forms over each canyon wall. The upstream DKW propagates offshore and is lost. The downstream DKW travels toward the coast where its energy accumulates. Some of this energy escapes as Kelvin waves. During the second phase, characterized by a slow vortex-stretching time-scale, closed circulations form over the shelf and canyon. The extent of the patterns inside the canyon and the degree of their organization appears to be related to the canyon's width; wider canyons contain better organized flow. The shelf flow patterns are more a result of the proximity to the domain ends than the canyon's width. An interesting phenomenon is the generation of freely-translating eddies which form at the canyon-coastline junction. They form as fluid is moved from the canyon onto the shelf by the cross-step velocity of short wavelength DKW. These anticyclonic features leave the canyon within 6 days. Their radius is the local deformation radius. Lagrangian tracers verify that fluid in the anticyclone is from the canyon... 0aSubmarine valleys. 0aOcean currentsxMeasurement. 0aBaroclinic models. 0aEddies. 4aMajor oceanography. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBrooks, David,edegree supervisor.1 aChang, Ping,edegree supervisor.1 aNassersharif, Braham,edegree committee member.1 aNorth, Gerald,edegree committee member.1 aNowlin, Worth,edegree committee member.1 aReid, Robert O.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1449207zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746519721&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs173ce450-5ed7-34d1-ab6a-f1e6cae985f7i42439be5-6a4c-36d5-bdbd-beebdbb2641303938ctm a2200445Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180100002700189245006700216264001000283300004600293336002600339337002800365338002700393500002800420502004100448500001000489504004100499500004400540520220700584650002602791650002402817650003002841650003302871655002702904700004502931700004702976700004503023700004103068710005803109856007803167856015603245994001203401999007903413in0000112815620200904152620.0930415s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27924381  9AFW7803AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27924381  aTXAM1 aHeggelund, Dag Gustav.10aIn-situ steam generation using electrical resistance heating / 1c1992.  axiv, 157 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

ISSG uses ERH to generate steam in-situ for steam flooding. The heat generated by ERH comes from the flow of low frequency electrical current through the formation. The ERH process has been studied by several authors[^1'13]. Previously studied applications of the ERH process have concentrated on oil production wells and water injection wells. These applications have mainly been conducted below the boiling point of water to avoid the problem with increasing formation resistivity due to water vaporization. The objective of this work was to study the engineering aspects of the ISSG process. A numerical finite difference 2-D, r-z simulator was developed for this study. The simulator consists of a fluid and energy flow model, an electrical flow model, and an over and underburden model. This study considered two processes: A) single injection well and B) cyclic steam injection. A variation of the Fourth SPE comparative study^16 was used as the base case. For the single injection well process, the variables studied were electrode length, electrode placement, injection interval, and ERH rate. For the cyclic steam injection process, the variables studied were heating during the production cycle, rate of ERH, and rate of water injection. The ISSG process may be used as an alternative to conventional steam injection (CSI) when either physical or environmental restrictions prohibits the use of CSI. The fuel cost ratio of the ISSG process to CSI appears to be at least 5.5. The steam injection study indicates that the efficiency of the ISSG process increases by decreasing the length of the electrode. The study also shows that water vaporization can be controlled by limiting water the injection interval to the electrode interval. The cyclic steam injection work show that: 1) heating during the production cycle is very ineffective, 2) the effect of increasing the electrical power is most effective when no steam is present during the injection cycle, and 3) the effect of increasing the water injection rate is most effective when steam is present during the injection cycle. 0aThermal oil recovery. 0aResistance heating. 0aInjection wellsxTesting. 4aMajor petroleum engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWattenbarger, R.

One aspect of this dissertation was to assess the utility of an in vitro induction bioassay to accurately estimate the toxicity of a complex environmental mixture of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The bioassay analysis of Great Lakes fish extracts and extracts from pyrolysed brominated flame retardants gave results comparable to those obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) chemical analysis and in vivo toxicity studies, thus validating the utility of this bioassay for assessing the potential toxicity of complex environmental mixtures. The in vitro induction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity is a receptor-mediated response analogous to the regulation of genes by steroid hormones and their receptors. This structure-dependent response appears to require ligand activation of Ah receptors and is not the result of differences in: 1) molecular properties, 2) capability to initiate transcription and/or 3) rates of processing of nuclear Ah receptor complexes. Like the steroid hormone receptors, the accumulation of nuclear Ah receptor complexes is enhanced in a dose-, time-, structure- and cell-dependent manner by DNA intercalators and protein synthesis inhibitors. These studies revealed a high level of nuclear Ah receptors and suggest that these effects were the result of both stabilization of receptor complex-DNA interactions and inhibition of protein synthesis. The induction of AHH and EROD activity by 2,3,7,8-TCDD can also be antagonized by 6-methyl-l,3,8- trichlorodibenzofuran (MCDF) and its iodinated analog 6-methyl-8-iodo-l,3- dichlorodibenzofuran in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Antagonism by MCDF is not the result of competitive inhibition but appears to to be a post-transcriptionally regulated effect. Finally, the effects 2,3,7,8-TCDD and related compounds on the downregulation of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) levels was investigated... 0aPolychlorinated dibenzofuransxIn vitro. 0aPolychlorinated dibenzodioxinsxIn vitro. 0aEnzyme inductionxAnalysis. 4aMajor toxicology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aSafe, Stephen H.,edegree supervisor.1 aIvie, G.

Previous studies have suggested that a very high localized concentration of the hydroxyl radical produced by the radiolysis of water can react with atmospheric trace gases such as SO2 and produce lower vapor pressure compounds that can subsequently nucleate. To determine the trace gas and water vapor concentration dependence of the active, positively charged, first decay product of radon, a well-controlled experimental chamber, the Illinois-Clarkson system, was used in this research. The mobility spectrum of the decay products in the range of 0.07-5.0 cm^2/V*sec from the Illinois-Clarkson radon chamber was measured using a specially-designed mobility spectrometer. Measurements were taken for different relative humidities and concentrations of SO2 in purified, compressed air. The mobility of a new-born Po-218 ion measured by the spectrometer was determined to be 1.92 cm^2/V*sec. A comparison of the theoretical and measured alpha track densities was completed to investigate the performance of the ion spectrometer. The resultant mobility spectra at low and high humidities were compared. A Condensation Nuclei Counter (CNC) was used for counting condensation nuclei in each experiment. In the case of low humidities, the reduction of available hydroxyl radical concentration, and hence the neutralization rate, leads to an increase of the shoulder around 1.35 cm^2/V*sec with increasing SO2. This suggests SO2 clustering around the PoO[x]+ ion. For a high humidity condition (5 ppm SO2, 30 % RH), there was clear droplet formation, H2SO4 clustering around the ion and also an increase in the background level between the high mobility peak and the droplet peak. A kinetics study for interpretation of the reaction processes was performed. 0aAtmospheric radon. 0aIon mobility spectroscopy. 0aPolonium. 4aMajor nuclear engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMarlow, William H.,edegree supervisor.1 aHassan, Yassin A.,edegree committee member.1 aMcFarland, Andrew R.,edegree committee member.1 aMcLain, Milton E.,edegree committee member.1 aPoston, John W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910701341xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1120389zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745089931&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs09c39deb-5abb-3669-b7ad-2090d5fae9a7i47eed557-d40c-373b-8814-c81781cab14f04131ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003500223245015900258264001000417300004500427336002600472337002800498338002700526500002800553502004100581500001000622504004100632500004900673650004300722650004300765650001800808650001800826650003800844655002700882700004000909700004900949700005100998700004801049710005801097856016901155856007801324520200001402856015603402994001203558999007903570in0000099747120200904152537.0910329s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23354313  9AEZ1742AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23354313  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaW5521 aWhaley, Patricia Diane,d1961-10aIntracellular signal transduction systems involved in the release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone from the mediobasal hypothalamus of male rats / 1c1990.  axii, 78 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

A potential linkage between the systems may involve the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid (PA) and its subsequent metabolism to arachidonic acid. Consequently, this study was conducted to: 1) validate of the use of rat mediobasal hypothalamic (MBH) slices in a perifusion culture system to study LHRH release and 2) investigate the involvement of and possible linkage between AC and PI in LHRH release. MBH from male rats were placed in 500 p.1 perifusion chambers and perifused at a rate of 25 μl/min with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate media (5.5 mM glucose) at 37° C under an atmosphere of 95% 02:5% CO2- Effluent fractions were collected into tubes on ice over 30 min intervals. Treatment compounds were introduced between 210 and 330 min of perifusion, while control tissues were left untreated. LHRH content (pg/30 min) of the fractions was determined by validated radioimmunoassay. Area under the LHRH release curve was determined using the trapezoidal rule. Sliced MBH (4 MBH units/chamber) demonstrated greater (P<.05) depolarization-induced LHRH release when compared with intact MBH. All subsequent experiments utilized 3 sliced MBH per chamber. Tissues from adult male rats did not respond (P>.1) to either 60mM K+ or 3 μm PGE2 compared to controls. MBH tissues obtained from immature rates responded (P<.05) to 60 mM K+, but were unresponsive (P>.1) to 3 μM PGE2 treatment. However, a 30 μM dose of PGE2 induced (P<.01) LHRH release from the MBH of immature rates.

Because it is an internal and often solitary process, we still have much to learn about the development of written language. According to Piaget and others, most adolescents have reached the point of becoming independent agents in their cognitive development; however, national reports and other research findings show poor results in adolescents* abilities to express themselves effectively in writing. Findings suggest that it is often during this critical period that the least developmental work in writing occurs and that writing evaluation and feedback to students are frequently counterproductive. This study explores the effects of strategies that current theory in developmental psychology, composing, and creativity propose to be effective with students of this age group. These strategies include active involvement in learning, facilitative and directive feedback, and a gradual shift of responsibility for learning and performance to learners themselves. In this study, such strategies were implemented in regular classroom settings by three language arts teachers with 160 sixth grade also explores the likelihood that when students gain in one of these outcome variables they also gain in the others and, further, that students' first language relates in some way to the reported outcomes. For this study, strategies were implemented through a writing program in regular classroom settings by three language arts teachers with 160 sixth grade students. The program was implemented over a seven-month period. Sixty-five percent of the study population was characterized as low SES, and approximately 60% was non-Englishspeaking. The outcomes of the three key variables were measured using a series of five writing events as well as tests of writing apprehension and verbal creativity. The data were analyzed by examining students' gains on these measures. Teachers and classes were compared for possible replication of the outcomes of the writing program. Findings suggest that, when the writing program strategies were implemented, students showed gains in the variables of interest - writing achievement, attitude toward writing, and verbal creativity - and that, as a group, the non-English-speaking students made greater gains on these three criteria than did their English-speaking classmates. 4aMajor educational psychology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMcNamara, James F.,edegree supervisor.1 aAsh, Michael J.,edegree committee member.1 aHill, Rodney C.,edegree committee member.1 aNash, William R.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740930491&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551607zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740930491&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs084bc42b-5fe9-3ed3-b1c6-72908a93b2f4i493f5ae0-30fc-32b6-a2a4-ff0351f0d25703460ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002800180100001600208245013100224264001000355300004700365336002600412337002800438338002700466504004100493500001000534502004100544500003400585520163400619650002302253655002702276700003902303700004802342700004802390700004802438710005802486856016902544856007802713856015602791994001202947999007902959in0000128426820200904152712.0960404s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34511714  9AGY0057AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34511714  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaK751 aKo, Jangho.14aThe learning of generalized motor program and parameterization :bpractice composition effects on retention of a motor skill / 1c1993.  aviii, 120 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

These findings are consistent with the variability of practice hypothesis derived from schema theory (Schmidt, 1975, 1976) , in which movement production is based on a generalized motor program (GMP) and variable practice leads to a stronger, more robust schema than specific practice. The purpose of the present experiments was to reinvestigate the variable practice effect found by Shea and Kohl (1990,1991) and to examine whether manipulations of practice composition would have effects on the learning of GMP and parameter specification. Subjects practiced either a single movement (C) or three movement patterns (A, C, & E) with the same relative forces and the same relative timing, but with different absolute forces (Exp. 1) or different absolute timing (Exp. 2). Retention was assessed on task C. The retention results indicated that the specification of the fixed parameter was facilitated by variable practice with the parameter that was varied during practice. However, overall proficiency analyzed by RMS error and the learning of GMP assessed by scaled RMS error failed to indicate the benefit of variable practice on retention. These results are inconsistent with the findings of Shea and Kohl (1990, 1991) in terms of overall performance and Wulf and colleagues (Wulf & Lee,1993; Wulf & Schmidt, 1989, 1993; Wulf, Schmidt, & Deubel, 1993; Wulf, 1992) in terms of the learning of GMP. 4aMajor kinesiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aShea, Charles,edegree supervisor.1 aGabbard, Carl P.,edegree committee member.1 aSmith, Steven M.,edegree committee member.1 aWright, David L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941082441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1529841zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745528511&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsc1a4b32a-3703-3978-a0ed-2b48613632e1i49bbe540-a4d3-369a-b4da-a6974991f2c204114ctm a2200493Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099002900201100003700230245010600267264001000373300004500383336002600428337002800454338002700482500002800509502004100537500001000578504004100588500004500629520202200674650005402696650006202750650003402812650006602846650005802912651005202970655002703022700004803049700004703097700004403144700004903188710005803237856007803295856015603373994001203529999007903541in0000111232720200904152539.0921008s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm26750214  9AFU7014AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)26750214  ad------  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaA3791 aAlexander-Flinn, Gretcha,d1957-10aPerceptions of decision makers whose programs impact rural sector women in less developed countries / 1c1991.  axi, 120 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

A survey questionnaire designed to answer ten research questions was mailed to three hundred decision makers who were participating actively in international development activities at the time of the study. One hundred eighty instruments were returned between July 19, 1991 and September 6, 1991. The questionnaire was tested for face validity and reliability. The findings suggest that there was no significant difference among the perceptions of individuals employed by governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, university research programs, and university administration concerning gender issues. Further, no significant difference existed between the perceptions of individuals located in the United States and Canada and individuals located outside of the U.S. and Canada. The decision makers held generally positive opinions about working with women's programs. They recognized the importance of gender issues, and identified their perceptions of the most critical needs. They also recognized the obstacles that prevented those needs from being met. Their perception was that only 17% of women's needs are being met by current international projects. These decision makers recognized that a woman's day is fractured into many activities. The most time consuming activities were identified as food production, fuel harvesting, and water hauling. Women targeted to benefit from development projects were perceived by these decision makers as having numerous positive attributes; however, these high praises were balanced by the recognition that serious negative factors were also at work, such as cultural and traditional beliefs. Respondents were divided on which of the terms, "women in development" or "women and development," they preferred for female-targeted international activities. 0aWomen in rural developmentzDeveloping countries. 0aRural developmentzDeveloping countriesxDecision making. 4aMajor agricultural education. 7aRural developmentxDecision making.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01101505 7aWomen in rural development.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01177966 7aDeveloping countries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01242969 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aChristiansen, James E.,edegree supervisor.1 aHerring, Don R.,edegree committee member.1 aLarke, Alvin,edegree committee member.1 aStone, Barbara N.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1274315zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745945501&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs8244c3d1-c34c-30e2-8a77-854b979c64b2i49fb440a-1b42-3008-abe4-27a7a89b9d2704587ctm a2200529Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172043001200192049000900204099003200213100003100245245009700276264001000373300002900383336002600412337002800438338002700466500002800493502004100521500001000562504004100572500004900613520229100662650003202953650003002985650003903015650005803054650004903112650005103161651003703212650003803249655002703287700004303314700005203357700004603409700005103455710005803506856016903564856007703733856015603810994001203966999007903978in0000078241620200904152412.0890907s1988    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm20310473  9ADM2841AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)20310473  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1988aDisser-atationaA3841 aAlexius, Barbara Brittain.10aAttitudes of principals and teachers toward teacher appraisal as mandated by House Bill 72 / 1c1988.  axii, 145 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

In order to accomplish this purpose, the researcher sought answers to the following questions: 1. What are principal and teacher attitudes toward the appraisal process? 2. Are principal and teacher attitudes the same toward the appraisal process regardless of school district size? A five-point Likert scale was used to assess educators' attitudes. Four hundred Texas school districts were randomly selected to receive questionnaires. Three principals and three teachers (one each at elementary, middle, and high school levels) received questionnaires. Two hundred thirty-five districts responded to the survey. Data were analyzed to obtain frequencies, percentages, means and standard deviations for responses and an analysis of variance was conducted to determine differences between and within groups, especially with regard to school district size. Half of those responding were unsure of the clarity of House Bill 72 or felt it was unclear. The majority of educators agreed that the career ladder had a dual purpose--to maximize professional growth through diagnosis and prescription and to provide monetary rewards for exceptional teachers. Teachers are strongly in favor of their involvement in the development of the appraisal process. Both teachers and principals believe that the trained principal should have major responsibility for the appraisal process. Differences in attitudes toward commitment to funding, use of a single evaluation instrument, qualifications for appraisers, and selection of appraisers by teachers are all affected by district size. The most meaningful finding with regard to practical significance was differences in attitudes between teachers and principals toward teacher selection of appraisers. One of the main implications of this study is that its substantive, long-term success could be seriously impaired because the majority of principals and teachers surveyed did not feel informed or significantly involved in initial implementation of change. Several specific recommendations for additional research related to educators' attitudes toward change and increased involvement in change were suggested. 0aTeachersxRating ofzTexas. 0aSchool principalszTexas. 0aEducational accountabilityzTexas. 7aEducational accountability.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00903326 7aSchool principals.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01107681 7aTeachersxRating of.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01144352 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 4aMajor educational administration. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStark, Stephen L.,edegree supervisor.1 aBratlien, Maynard J.,edegree committee member.1 aSavage, Tom V.,edegree committee member.1 aStenning, Walter F.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:890475741xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-792004zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745284731&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffscc08cf0b-c8d9-36a7-8834-1d6e4d889baai4af450ed-4fe4-34ce-a381-24c9db83ad9504266ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099003000194100002700224245010200251264001000353300004400363336002600407337002800433338002700461500002800488502004100516500001000557504004100567500004000608520230200648650003302950650002502983650002903008655002703037700004403064700004903108700005103157700004803208710005803256856016903314856007803483856015603561994001203717999007903729in0000104297320200904152511.0910821s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24261665  9AFG7481AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)24261665  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaK49551 aKim, Youngchan,d1961-10aDevelopment of optimization models for signalized intersections during oversaturated conditions / 1c1990.  ax, 149 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

A dynamic optimization model was developed as the principal product of this research. The dynamic model's control objective is to provide maximum system productivity as well as minimum delay for a selected roadway system. A special feature of this model is its ability to manage queue lengths on external approaches up to predetermined upper limits. The model formulated to handle problems involving two intersections was extended to control three different roadway types: a conventional diamond interchange, a three-level diamond interchange, and an urban arterial with a critical intersection. The optimization model took the form of mixed integer linear programming. The control strategies generated by these modified dynamic models were compared with those derived from conventional signal timing models, using the TRAF-NETSIM microscopic simulation model. It was found that the modified dynamic models successfully produced optimal signal timing plans for the various oversaturated signalized intersections. The dynamic models consistently outperformed the conventional models with respect to system productivity. This conclusion was drawn from the TRAF-NETSIM simulation. The dynamic model solutions significantly reduced total system delay for most test cases, while slightly increasing the delay for a few test cases. Queue management on external approaches is a primary concern in the control of congested signalized diamond interchanges. The dynamic model was found to be superior to the conventional models in queue management for the congested interchanges. Queue spillback to upstream intersections is a major concern in the arterial systems having a critical intersection. The dynamic model solutions produced a significantly smaller queue spillback than the conventional model, TRANSYT-7F. The dynamic model controls queue lengths by the efficient and timely changing of signal timing plans as demand changes. The traffic control strategies presented in this research were also designed to minimize the transitional delay from frequent changes of the timing plans. The control strategies appeared effective in reducing this delay. 0aElectronic traffic controls. 0aTraffic engineering. 4aMajor civil engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMesser, Carroll J.,edegree supervisor.1 aFambro, Daniel B.,edegree committee member.1 aKrammes, Raymond A.,edegree committee member.1 aPhillips, Don T.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911825841xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1190533zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746213761&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs0c9ee7b4-ab65-3308-ac27-6c5986c7b274i4bc49407-574e-3621-b90b-489a44e09c5404468ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002800180100002900208245013800237264001000375300004700385336002600432337002800458338002700486500002800513502004100541500001000582504004100592500003100633520247600664650001803140650003303158650002003191650002003211655002703231700004303258700004703301700004903348700004903397710005803446856016903504856007803673856015603751994001203907999007903919in0000099747620200904152538.0910329s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23354594  9AEZ1747AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23354594  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaY221 aYang, Chwen-Ming,d1957-10aEffects of high temperature upon photosynthesis, respiration, and growth and yield of rice plants :ba controlled environment study / 1c1990.  axiii, 132 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Photosynthesis and respiration were determined by the CO2 exchange using the infrared gas analysis technique. Growth and development were evaluated by measuring agronomic characteristics and leaf stage, respectively. The yield performance was estimated by measuring yield characteristics. Short term high temperature in the vegetative stage did not affect yield characteristics. Variations of agronomic characteristics and development patterns occurred for short period of time after treatments, suggesting that growing points and some metabolic activities may be injured rather than the carbon balance. High temperature in the grain -filling stage affected yield through lower spikelet numbers, high percentage of sterility and reduced grain weights. Diurnal changes of stomatal conductance were observed under controlled environments. A decreasing trend of stomatal conductance was found in the vegetative growth phase. Conductance increased dramatically from panicle initiation through heading to early grain -filling, which may be a compromise of its own carbon economy. Stomatal movements of rice plants were sensitive to temperature changes. High temperature stimulated the opening of stomata yet preserved diurnal pattern of stomatal variations. High temperature enhanced the CO2 exchange rates in both stages. Temperature effects on the carbon balance were through the changes of the relationship between growth and maintenance. Differences in the daily gain of carbon between treatments depended on the counterbalance of synthetic rate versus respiration rate. The yield of growth was little affected by temperature yet increased slightly from young plant to matured plant, suggesting changes in the com position of biosynthetic end products. High temperature increased maintenance coefficient (m) because metabolic rate increased with increasing temperature. The value form decreased from the vegetative stage to the grain -filling stage, suggesting changes of the protein fraction and composition. Substrates consumed in respiration were utilized more in maintenance than in growth. High temperature enlarged the respiration differences. Obviously, less biomass was produced from the available substrates consumed in heat-treated plants of a greater demand for maintaining the existing plant biomass. 0aRicexYields. 0aRicexEffect of temperature. 0aPhotosynthesis. 4aMajor agronomy. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHeilman, James L.,edegree supervisor.1 aCothren, J.

Reducing the number of participants in a usability test or using heuristic evaluation are the two approaches most often associated with discount methods. In this dissertation, an alternative heuristic method was developed based on the concept of a double specialist (knowledge of usability techniques and of a software product domain). Double specialists were previously shown to provide heuristic evaluation superior to that of regular usability professionals, primarily because of their knowledge of usability problems typically found within the given domain. Similar knowledge, based on competitive usability testing, was used to devise a domain-specific heuristic checklist. The product domain chosen for the research was online calendars. The calendar checklist was compared to general heuristics and to streamlined usability testing with two usability test subjects. Fifteen software developers and fifteen usability professionals were each randomly assigned to one of the three evaluation methods. They were then provided with a previously unseen software calendar and were asked to find as many usability problems as possible. Participants using the calendar checklist found more total problems, and a significantly higher percentage of user-oriented problems and severe problems than did those using the general heuristic method, suggesting that domain-specific heuristics do provide an improved heuristic approach. Streamlined usability testing, however, was found to be the most effective discount usability method. Usability professionals and software developers did not differ in their ability to find user-oriented or severe problems. It was concluded that when time and resources permit, usability testing is the method of choice. When user testing is not feasible, however, domain-specific heuristics may provide results approaching the effectiveness of the double specialist. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aEllis, Newton C.,edegree supervisor.1 aMitta, Deborah A.,edegree supervisor.1 aKoppa, Rodger J.,edegree committee member.1 aSimmons, Dick B.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941076141xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1526964zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745768501&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs4d542bed-628c-3656-a825-d6038b392be5i4c4ae630-2c10-3cae-911b-18d3443d660704080ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100003400209245007900243264001000322300004400332336002600376337002800402338002700430500002800457502004100485500001000526504004100536500004100577520211100618650004102729650001402770650001602784650001202800650003002812655002702842700003902869700004602908700004702954700004503001710005803046856016903104856007803273856015603351994001203507999007903519in0000099824220200904152535.0910115s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22964781  9AEY7891AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)22964781  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaT4291 aThiebaud, Karla Renee,d1958-12aA kinetic and kinematic comparison of the traditional and sumo deadlifts / 1c1990.  ax, 127 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The risk of injury to the low-back is increased in the deadlift due to the heavy loads that are lifted. While it is generally accepted that the traditional style deadlift creates a greater force on the 1umbo-sacral articulation than the sumo style, the actual forces incurred during the deadlift have not been determined. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the traditional and sumo style deadlifts with respect to lumbo-sacral forces and angular positions and velocities of the relative trunk and knee. Subjects were competitive traditional (n=4) or sumo (n=4) style deadlifters. The subjects were videotaped with an Olympus VHS movie video camera operating at a speed of 30 frames per second while performing three lifts at each of three weights (40, 60, & 80% of maximum) with a five minute rest between each lift. Coordinate data for the start, mid-point, and end of each lift were collected using a Targa 16 image capture board. Joint centers for a the ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, and the bar were digitized. The resultant muscle force, compression force, and shear force at the lumbo-sacral articulation were determined. In addition, the angular positions and velocities of the relative trunk and knee were obtained. For each variable, the average of the three trials per weight was used in the analysis. The traditional and sumo deadlifts were found to differ with respect to the resultant muscle force, compression force, and angular position of the relative trunk. No differences were found between the two lifting styles for shear force, angular position of the knee, or angular velocities of the relative trunk or knee. Evidence was found to suggest that traditional style deadlifters may be more prone to muscle strain and compression injuries at the L5/S1 articulation than are sumo style deadlifters. Evidence was also found to suggest that large incremental increases in the weight of the load may increase the risk of muscle, compression, and shear injuries to the lumbo-sacral articulation. 0aWeight liftingxWounds and injuries. 0aBackache. 0aKinematics. 0aMotion. 4aMajor physical education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDowell, Linus,edegree supervisor.1 aElledge, Jerry,edegree committee member.1 aLessard Charles,edegree committee member.1 aTolson, Homer,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:902728141xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1117108zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747128741&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs5a09f881-6cf1-38e4-a8ff-805497af12dei4cbaf1fb-4f75-3bb0-93d0-bc04f0a0513b04119ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165043001200185049000900197099002900206100002100235245008600256264001000342300004500352336002600397337002800423338002700451500002800478502004100506500001000547504004100557500003500598520194500633650003402578650004502612650001802657650005402675651004602729650002402775655002702799700004002826700004702866700004302913700004702956700004603003710005803049856016903107856007803276856015603354994001203510999007903522in0000099578420200904152506.0901220s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22880255  9AEX9003AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)22880255  anm-----  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaG1661 aGallegos, Sonia.10aEvaluation of the potential of the NOAA-n AVHRR reflective data in oceanography / 1c1990.  axv, 189 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This study investigates the capabilities of the reflective data of the NOAA-n Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to detect and map features associated with phytoplankton concentrations at the ocean surface. Considering the capabilities of satellite observation for this problem, the more accessible data sets from the NOAA-n AVHRR are examined, and techniques designed to exploit the full sensitivity of the instrument are introduced. These procedures include an editing technique that maintains the full resolution in the low albedoes pertaining to ocean targets and a normalizing procedure to account for atmospheric contributions to the signal. The atmospheric effects are treated as functions of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere and the position of the individual pixels along the swath width of the instrument. These techniques permit the refinement of the reflective data to 0.1% albedo and the expansion of acceptable data to at least 512 pixels on either side of nadir. Data obtained with these methodologies are compared with near-simultaneous and pigment calibrated Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) data. These two sets of data are segmented using a mathematical classification technique and then compared to determine similarity of spatio-temporal features. To verify the AVHRR findings, these data are compared to concurrent in-situ data from two red tide incidents in the eastern and western coasts of the Gulf of Mexico during 1983 and 1986, respectively. Comparisons are also made between AVHRR reflective and emittive data to investigate possible relationships existing between the circulation patterns and phytoplankton distributions. 0aOcean-atmosphere interaction. 0aOceanographyxResearchzMexico, Gulf of. 0aOcean bottom. 7aOceanographyxResearch.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01043704 7aGulf of Mexico.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01239980 4aMajor oceanography. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDarnell, R.

FTMP provides distributed reliability services to application programs in a highly redundant, loosely coupled, distributed network. Design goals for this research included network and location transparency for the applications; topology and operating system independence; the ability to diagnose, contain, and recover from both hardware and software failures; and provision for future protocol extensions. The goal of topology independence is significant in that it prevents the use of existing network broadcast and routing services, while offering the use of much more fault tolerant network designs, such as planar-2. The design approach used includes both the addition of new vertical operating system layers, as well as full distribution and data replication for these new services. Vertical layering is used to place fault tolerance appropriately. While many prior efforts have centered only on hardware based methods, or application based methods, this approach recognizes that fault tolerance is needed in all levels, including hardware, device driver, operating system kernel, library, and application layers. In addition, two new layers are added between the application and traditional operating system, to provide desired new distributed services. The specific design provides the necessary operating system extensions with one service daemon per node. This daemon implements FTMP in a fully distributed fashion. In addition, an interface library is provided which simplifies the application's use of the FTMP services, while also implementing some of the fault tolerance services on a per application basis. Together, the interface library and service daemon provide automatic detection and correction of hardware and software failures, location transparent communication through distributed named ports, automatic critical file remote replication, and distributed object handling. A version is implemented in a 4 by 4 planar-2 mesh of Sun processors running Sun UNIX. This implementation is evaluated for completeness, correct operation, and efficiency. The results demonstrate that FTMP provides powerful tools for highly reliable distributed applications. 0aOperating systems (Computers) 0aFault-tolerant computing. 0aElectronic data processingxDistributed processing. 0aComputer network protocols. 4aMajor computer science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPooch, Udo W.,edegree supervisor.1 aSheppard, Sallie V.,edegree supervisor.1 aFriesen, Donald K.,edegree committee member.1 aKoppa, Rodger,edegree committee member.1 aMcCormick, Bruce H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911830441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1174770zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746213941&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsc17bb035-ede1-33fa-bae2-4b9dafa795f4i4d4e265c-9b5d-3457-aa4b-6be6ebb0be9f02741ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002300209245003600232264001000268300004500278336002600323337002800349338002700377504004100404500001000445502004100455500004500496650003400541655002700575700004200602700004400644700004800688700004500736710005800781856016900839856007801008520098601086856015602072994001202228999007902240in0000125976220200904152645.0960322s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34432744  9AGX3605AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34432744  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaA3551 aAlcoz, Jorge Jose.10aFiber-optic frequency shifter / 1c1993.  axi, 102 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

It consists of a birefringent optical fiber embedded in an aluminum acoustic waveguide. Light with a wavelength of 1.3 μm enters the input fiber polarized along one of its principal axes and is coupled to the orthogonal axis by the induced birefringence produced by a traveling ultrasound wave. This acousto-optic interaction shifts the frequency of the light by the frequency of the acoustic wave, in the vicinity of 1 MHz. Different prototypes were fabricated, and sideband suppression of 30 dB and carrier suppression of 26 dB were measured, using 500 mW of electrical driving power. The fabrication of this frequency shifter was made possible by the development of a process that allowed for the first time the embedding of optical fibers in aluminum. The resulting device is very sturdy and easy to fabricate, in contrast to alternative types of fiber-optic frequency shifters.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745767751&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs3a1a792c-aa0e-3a2e-b06b-8fa8ab8fc551i4dfd036f-af82-38a3-a777-7e10281c74be04283ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003500223245008700258264001000345300004500355336002600400337002800426338002700454504004100481500001000522502004100532500004000573520225400613650003102867650004402898650001602942650002202958650002902980655002703009700003803036700003903074700004403113700004603157700004603203710005803249856016903307856007803476856015603554994001203710999007903722in0000121711720200904152649.0950417s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32321123  9AGS1385AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32321123  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaB6941 aBolton, Robert William,d1953-10aBit temperature measurement in printed circuit boards with an infrared pyrometer / 1c1993.  axv, 248 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Cited research indicated drilling temperatures are related to many plated-through-hole defects. This investigation was divided into three phases: developing a suitable on-line measurement system, documenting sensor responses, and evaluating the sensitivity of temperature to a comprehensive set of drilling factors. Six data sets were generated. Four documented sensor responses and sources of measurement error including; peak entry and exit temperatures for a 2500-hit drill run at constant speed and feed, time traces from individual drill cycles for temperature and a complex pressure foot-thrust force, bit emissivity measurements, and data demonstrating the significant effect of IR probe position on exit temperature. Sensitivity of temperature to several drilling factors was evaluated in two designed experiments for 18-mil and 42-mil solid carbide designs drilled in FR-4 multilayer panels. Factors included: surface speed, chip load, head height, number of panels, hits, and localized differences in layer geometry. Measured responses included; thrust force, bit temperature, and changes in bit relief areas. A unique blocking methodology was used in these designed experiments. Balanced factor combinations were distributed in small blocks through the linear response region of each bit. All bits exhibited dynamic temperature cycling with cooling between holes exceeding 70°C. Measured emissivity changes were minimal. Bits of different design/diameter exhibited different responses. 42-mil designs showed large nonlinear increases in temperature during break-in followed by linearly increasing response in later hits. Within 200-hit blocks 42-mil response was sometimes nonlinearly increasing or decreasing, and exhibited positive and negative changes in slope. 18-mil designs produced relatively linear responses with slightly negative overall slopes. In general, temperatures were affected most by bit design/diameter, stack, height, percent copper layers, chip load, and speed. Temperature was affected least by head height, variations among bits of the same design, and higher order interactions. 0aBits (Drilling and boring) 0aDrilling and boring machineryxTesting. 0aPyrometers. 0aPrinted circuits. 4aMajor civil engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHough, C.

One of the changes mandated that 40% of secondary science class time be spent on "hands- on" activities. The purpose of this study was to develop a list of technical competencies needed by all teachers to effectively implement and successfully instruct a Chemistry I laboratory program. A careful review of the laboratory manuals that accompany the state-adopted Chemistry I textbooks generated a list of technical and safety laboratory teaching competencies. The list was validated by a panel of experts in chemistry, science education, and chemistry teaching. The survey instrument was composed of 120 technical and safety laboratory teaching competencies, accompanied by a demographic checklist. Professional and experienced Chemistry I teachers with membership in the Associated Chemistry Teachers of Texas (ACT2), pre-service teachers enrolled in secondary science methods courses in the Spring of 1989 and seeking certification in chemistry and/or composite science, university/college chemistry professors known to be involved in chemical education , and science teacher educators were surveyed. There was greater agreement between ACT2 teachers and pre-service teachers than between ACT2 teachers and the other groups as to the number of technical and laboratory teaching competencies needed to teach Chemistry I. Chemistry majors reported having more of these competencies than other science majors or education majors. Unsolicited comments showed that many ACT2 teachers applauded the establishment of a list of needed technical and laboratory teaching competencies. After analyses of the data, a recommended list of 110 technical and safety laboratory teaching competences was complied. 0aChemistryxStudy and teaching (Secondary) 0aChemical laboratoriesxSafety measures. 0aChemistry teachersxTraining of. 4aMajor curriculum and instruction. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aJames, Robert K.,edegree supervisor.1 aJanke, Delmar L.,edegree committee member.1 aPeck, Merlin L.,edegree committee member.1 aStuessy, Carol,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911824141xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1174775zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746146761&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd9dfa809-aae7-3c53-a538-fda72caa382ci4effe62b-d1ba-38b0-98c8-4fac2fb9a5c304573ctm a2200505Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172043001200192049000900204099002900213100003300242245005800275264001000333300003000343336002600373337002800399338002700427500002800454502004100482500001000523504004100533500003700574520247800611650003803089650002403127650003103151650005703182651003703239650002603276655002703302700004403329700004503373700005003418700004703468710005803515856016903573856007803742856015603820994001203976999007903988in0000101659220200904152533.0910806s1990    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24182560  9AFE9817AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)24182560  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS5251 aShafer, Brian Andrew,d1959-10aGenotype mixtures for control of leaf rust of wheat / 1c1990.  axiii, 168 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The studies were conducted in the 1985-86 and 1986-87 production seasons, at three locations in Central and South Texas, areas prone to severe leaf rust epidemics. Individual experiments utilized either winter or spring wheat genotypes with differing combinations of resistance genes, grown both with and without fungicide treatment. Yields of winter wheat mixtures significantly higher than the mean for the component genotypes were obtained in two of five mixture experiments, both with and without fungicide treatment. Yield component analysis revealed that the performance of some genotypes in mixtures varied significantly from their performance in pure stands. Grain volume weights for mixtures were significantly higher than corresponding weighted means for the components in two of five mixture experiments, for both treatments in one experiment, and for the treatment without fungicide in the other. Severities of leaf rust in mixtures were significantly lower than those for the mean of the components in two of five experiments in untreated plots, and for one of the experiments, in fungicide treated plots as well. Areas under the leaf rust disease progress curves for mixtures were significantly lower than corresponding means for the components in untreated comparisons for three of five winter wheat experiments, and for the fungicide treated comparison in one of them. Grain yields of spring wheat mixtures did not differ significantly from the means for their components in any experiment. Volume weights of spring wheat mixtures significantly exceeded the mean for the components in two of four mixture experiments in the absence of fungicide treatment. In one of the four spring wheat experiments, the severity of leaf rust in mixtures which did not receive fungicide treatment was significantly lower than the mean for the components, while in another of these experiments, the level of leaf rust for the mixture was significantly higher than the mean for the component genotypes. The areas under the leaf rust disease progress curves were significantly lower for mixtures than for the component mean in two experiments for the treatment which did not receive fungicide, and significantly higher for the mixture than the component mean for the same treatment in another experiment. 0aWheatxDiseases and pestszTexas. 0aLeaf rust of wheat. 0aWheatxVarietiesxTesting. 7aWheatxDiseases and pests.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01174343 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 4aMajor plant breeding. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBorlaug, Norman E.,edegree supervisor.1 aMcDaniel, Milton E.,edegree supervisor.1 aMarshall, David S.,edegree committee member.1 aTuleen, Neal A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911831041xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1174828zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746198521&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs23735525-8c88-3953-982a-b640703dd44fi4fa5e4b1-9531-354b-a9fb-2f036959787503246ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006500109035002000174084001600194049000900210099002900219100003000248245010800278264001000386300004700396336002600443337002800469338002700497500002800524502004100552500001000593504004100603500004500644520134000689650006302029650004502092650003102137650003402168655002702202700003902229700004602268700003802314700004102352710005802393856007802451856015602529994001202685999007902697in0000112739720200904152637.0930326s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27808221  9AFW7739AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdDEBBGdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27808221  aST 1902rvk  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaS5551 aShiau, Yan-Chyuan,d1957-10aTiming analysis of VLSI circuits using symbolic and visualization technics for practical applications / 1c1992.  axvii, 146 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The multi-dimensional function of various circuit combinations and device parameters is simplified to a two-dimensional model. This model estimates the timing delay of a circuit in terms of the generic RC delay and the rise/fall time delay of the input waveform. The auto-generator is developed to generate timing model for new process and technology. The Circuit Display Tool provide the capability for user to view the circuit topology from netlist in different level of display: Top-Level Circuit Display, SCC Display, and Cell Content Display. This tool not only shows user the content and control relations of cells in the design, but also displays the conducting situation for transistors in a cell. The active path can provide designers the actual signal path for selected object event in the circuit. The symbolic delay representation represents the delay of a sub-circuit with mathematical expression that shows the related components, such as transistors and nodes, which are deriving the subject output.

The acidity is a product of FeS2 oxidation. Mixed overburden topsoil substitutes containing FeS2, are often limed to prevent acid minesoil formation. The main objective of this study was to measure the effects of liming rates on the kinetics of FeS2 oxidation in overburden. To accomplish this objective, two overburden materials with different FeS2 content (1.9 and 4.1%) and low acid neutralization potential were limed with CaCO3. Lime rates of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125% were based on the amount of CaCO3 needed to provide an acid/base account (A/B[a]) of zero (A/B[a] = acid neutralization potential--Potential acidity--exchangeable acidity). The limed overburdens were inoculated with Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and leached weekly with deionized water for 53 weeks. Iron sulfide oxidation followed two different rate laws depending on the pH of the system. The oxidation followed zero-order kinetics with respect to FeS2 concentration at pH value above 4 and first-order kinetics below 4. The rate of oxidation was also found to differ with FeS2 source. The zero-order oxidation rate ranged from 0.01 to 0.46 μmol g^-1d^-1 in overburden 2 and from 0.01 to 0.22 μmol g^-1d^-1 in overburden 4. Oxidation following the first-order rate law had a first-order rate constant of 0.03 d^-1 in overburden 2 and 0.01 d^-1 in overburden 4. The calculated half-life is 23 and 69 d, respectively. Additions of CaCO3 affected FeS2 oxidation by controlling the pH of the system. The higher the pH the slower the oxidation. Liming to 25% of the A/B[a] deficit maintained the pH above 4 for approximately 100 d in overburden 4. At that time, oxidation changed from zero- to first-order. The addition of lime did not affect the subsequent half-life of FeS2 after the pH decreased below 4. Liming to greater than 50% A/B[a] deficit did not significantly affect the zero-order oxidation rate. The dissolution of the applied CaCO3 was found to be faster than the release of potential acidity. It is projected that the lime would dissolve out of the system before all the FeS2 would oxidize leaving the potential for acid minesoil formation.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747411791&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsa3c6aceb-30c7-31b6-beef-4bfe3313e241i52e2c60e-1906-3553-9288-17b90fc9588603489ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002800168100003800196245015600234264001000390300004500400336002600445337002800471338002700499504004100526500001000567502004100577500004400618520166100662650003302323655002702356700003502383700004602418700004202464700004502506710005802551856015602609856007802765856013302843994001202976999007902988in0000130076220200904152730.0960516s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34742359  9AHA3237AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34742359  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaJ631 aJochen, Valerie Ann Ellis,d1957-10aReservoir characterization of a coalbed methane openhole cavity completion using production and pressure transient data /cby Valerie Ann Ellis Jochen. 1c1994.  axi, 112 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

A major objective of the work was to identify a method that can be used to obtain a reservoir description in a coalbed methane reservoir. The methods proposed in the literature for estimating properties of coalbed methane reservoirs were evaluated. A more specific objective was to validate the method chosen for coalbed methane reservoir description in a specific geologic location. A good reservoir description may help quantify an increase in the effective permeability of the coal natural fracture system. This will help us to understand the reservoir conditions where cavitation may be a suitable stimulation technique for coalbed methane reservoirs. As a result of this research, several observations about coalbed methane wells have been made. This research indicates that (1) cavitation alone cannot account for all the increased gas production, (2) the use of a reservoir simulator is necessary to obtain a reservoir description, (3) the cavitation process forms an altered zone, (4) existing analytical solutions do not accurately characterize the complicated flow of a coal reservoir, (5) interference tests should not be analyzed using conventional or pseudopressure methods to estimate permeability between coalbed methane wells because of gas saturation gradients, and (6) lab relative permeability data should not be used for the Fruitland Formation coal sample. 4aMajor petroleum engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLee, W.J.,edegree supervisor.1 aHolditch, S.A.,edegree committee member.1 aBerg, R.R.,edegree committee member.1 aRussell, J.E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740896081&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551918zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740896081&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs37e81937-038a-3605-80b3-93ff597de6e7i532fc697-d1b9-35a3-bace-c5c42e427e3604009ctm a2200493Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006100109035002000170049000900190099002900199100003500228245016900263264001000432300002900442336002600471337002800497338002700525500002800552502004100580500001000621504004100631500003000672520174700702600005002449600005502499650001902554655002702573700006002600700006102660700004702721700005002768700004302818700005302861700004902914710005802963856016903021856007803190856015603268994001203424999007903436in0000099007820200904152533.0910318s1990    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23261133  9AEY9207AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCGdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23261133  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS5281 aShankle, Nancy Wilhite,d1956-10aGeorge Whitefield (1714-1770) :ba critical edition of The marks of the new birth and A sermon on regeneration together with a descriptive calendar of his sermons / 1c1990.  avii, 264 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

At his death in 1770, he left behind approximately 110 published sermons. Seventy-five of these sermons were printed in The Works of George Whitefield, a six-volume edition of letters, journals, tracts, and sermons published in 1771 and 1772. While a few collections of his sermons were reprinted in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, there has been no edition of sermons using the principles of modern textual criticism. Moreover, no complete bibliography of his sermons exists. The aim of this dissertation has been to demonstrate the need for bibliographic and textual studies of his sermons. The descriptive calendar provides the scholar with a complete record of Whitefield's sermons published in English in Britain or in the American colonies in the eighteenth century. It consists of two parts: Individual Sermons and Sermon Collections. The record includes scripture texts and provides a cross-reference to collections. The descriptive calendar is an important step toward a descriptive bibliography of his sermons. The two sermons, The Marks of the New Birth and  A Sermon on Regeneration, are edited using the techniques of modern textual criticism. These editions demonstrate the need for new editions because the collation of the first published text with Works and other texts shows that Whitefield revised some of these later editions in response to his critics. According to modern textual theory, these revisions are self-censorship and the original passages should be restored. Thus, this dissertation points to the need for a full-scale edition of his sermons and a full descriptive bibliography.10aWhitefield, George,d1714-1770vBibliography.10aWhiteield, George,d1714-1770xCriticism, Textual. 4aMajor English. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWhitefield, George,d1714-1770.tMark of the new birth.1 aWhitefield, George,d1714-1770.tSermon on regeneration.1 aMeserole, Harrison T.,edegree supervisor.1 aAnderson, David R.,edegree committee member.1 aBailey, Guy,edegree committee member.1 aHeffington, Warren M.,edegree committee member.1 aKallendorf, Craig,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910698941xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1118189zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744834941&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsbbf2f07c-3503-380f-9cd7-36e94c44252ei53ba8127-fe29-3fe3-8935-897f20dbc92603202cam a2200385K  4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001900095040007700114100008200191245016600273264003600439300001400475336002600489337002800515338002700543502004900570520132400619650002201943655004701965655008302012700002602095700003802121700004802159700004902207700004802256700004802304710010502352856007702457856015602534994001202690948003502702999007902737in0000017383720190325091227.0791204s1970    txu      m    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm05757672  a(OCoLC)5757672  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCGdOCLCQdTXAdOCLCOdOCLdOCLCOdUtOrBLW1 aTalati, Govind Motilal,d1929-0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n9105113410aComparative biological, behavioral and biochemical investigations of the cotton bollworm Heliothis zea (Boddie) and the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens (F.). 1a[College Station, Tex.],c1970.  a94 leaves  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  bPh.

Both species had similar patterns of development when reared on wheat germ diet at 80°F in the laboratory. Both species needed a little over one month's time from egg laying to adult emergence. Larvae of both species had speedier development when reared at mean temperatures of 87° F on wheat germ diet or on cotton plant parts at 80° F. The threshold temperatures for bollworm and budworm development were calculated to be 55° F and 52.5° F, respectively. The food requirements of bollworm larvae were significantly greater than for budworm larvae in order to complete development. Mean weights for full grown larvae and pupae were 525 mg and 345 mg for bollworms as against 325 mg and 221 mg for budworms. Widths of head capsules cast off at various molts were measured and recorded. Larvae of both species were attracted to fruiting parts of cotton plants in field investigations and preferred them to foliage. The larvae of both species, however, developed and pupated successfully when only leaves were available for food. Existence of a cannibalistic trait was confirmed for both species.. 4aMajor entomology. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf20140260391 a,edegree supervisor.1 aHanna, R.

The first part of the study reveals that effectively twice the diversity is available using multilevel codes than using a simple binary to M-ary mapping. We note that the complexity of decoding the multilevel code is nearly identical to that of decoding the binary mapped code. The second phase of the dissertation focuses on concatenated codes. Of the five systems proposed, one achieves a ninth order diversity for a 4-PSK signal set while another one yields an asymptotic sixteenth order for the 8-PSK constellation. The decoding complexity of the ninth order system can be greatly reduced if staged decoding is used on the inner multi level code. Likewise, the sixteenth order system can be easily implemented using our own soft decoder for the inner even-parity subcodes. We also consider the performance of multilevel structures on a time-varying channel. A practical example is proposed for the radio mobile channel featuring data transmission from a broadcasting station to a moving vehicle. Three dB gain is achieved and a diversity of second order protects the information in the event of a fading. This system has a low complexity level, with a rate 1/2 4-state convolutional code at the first decoding level and a simple rate 1/2 zero-sum code at the second level. Optimal and suboptimal strategies are used to decode the multilevel codes.

The filter structure is based on a universal biquadratic block realized by means of digitally controllable CMOS transconductance amplifiers and programmable capacitor arrays. Various system identification techniques are proposed to provide accurate performance measurements as required by the digital tuning algorithms which can be performed by an external tuning controller. With the specific CMOS implementation on a prototype experimental filter structure, the presented tuning algorithm can successfully tune a 2nd-order bandpass filter with less than 1% error on filter characteristics, namely resonant frequencies. 3dB bandwidths and the maximum gains. Tuning algorithms for general biquadratic filter functions are also discussed in this dissertation. Finally, future works are addressed by proposing the addition of automatic or semi-automatic analog tuning loops in the filter structure to compensate the deficiencies of digital tuning algorithms. 0aSignal processing. 0aElectric filters. 0aSystem identification. 0aMetal oxide semiconductors, Complementary. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGeiger, Randall L.,edegree supervisor.1 aBliss, William G.,edegree committee member.1 aMcCormick, Bruce H.,edegree committee member.1 aSanchez-Sinencio, Edgar,edegree committee member.1 aWatson, Karan L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1277013zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744867191&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs1dc9feb8-7a89-3d70-ac20-0050857b1479i58267256-f7b9-3dd8-946f-55bd7d07f0dc04184ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100004000218245004800258264001000306300004600316336002600362337002800388338002700416500002800443502004100471500001000512504004100522500004000563520237700603650005602980650002503036650003803061650002903099655002703128700004103155700004803196700004803244700005103292710005803343856007803401856015603479994001203635999007903647in0000111671820200904152610.0930312s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27720509  9AFV4810AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27720509  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaA4641 aAlsugair, Abdullah Mohammed,d1962-13aAn intelligent resource allocation system / 1c1992.  axii, 249 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The specific focuses of this research are capturing planning knowledge in selecting an appropriate equipment class, capturing planning experiences of allocating construction resources, and automating simulation studies. IRAS consists of three modules to accomplish the focuses of this research. These modules are an expert system, a pattern classification, and a Goal Driven Simulation System (GDSS). The functions of the expert system module are to capture planning knowledge in selecting a construction technology (e.g. scrapers) and an equipment class (e.g. conventional class of scrapers) and to recommend an appropriate equipment class based on process data (e.g. travel distance). The functions of the pattern classification modules are to capture the experiences of allocating construction resource, to recommend a preliminary resource assignment, and to adapt new experiences. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Backpropagation algorithm is used as the pattern classification tool. A justification for selecting ANN and Backpropagation algorithm is presented. The functions of the GDSS module are to allocate a final resource assignment and to automate simulation studies. GDSS consists of an integration of a simulation program and an analysis program that analyzes a simulation output and synthesizes an appropriate resource assignment. GDSS reduces the user's knowledge requirements in conducting simulation studies to specifying the goal (e.g. moving 300 CY/HR), the model data, and the number of equipment units. Using the goal as the ultimate objective, GDSS conducts a simulation study through alternating between the simulation program and the analysis program until the goal is satisfied and the assigned equipment are effectively utilized. The analysis and simulation programs are developed using C_language. The modules of IRAS prototype have been validated using an earthmoving process. GDSS module is restricted to automate the execution and analysis phases of a simulation study. Research results demonstrated that IRAS prototype shows a viable first phase toward fully automating the resource allocation process. 0aConstruction industryxManagementxData processing. 0aResource allocation. 0aExpert systems (Computer science) 4aMajor civil engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aChang, David Y.,edegree supervisor.1 aAnderson, Stuart,edegree committee member.1 aHancher, Donn E.,edegree committee member.1 aKehtarnavaz, Nasser,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1281164zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747653401&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsa7bc4e08-f55a-3b3c-b1f4-735e168ecd44i58ec7909-a5f0-3dbe-8f91-c2d743ae745f03941ctm a2200433Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100003500209245008400244264001000328300004600338336002600384337002800410338002700438504004100465500001000506502004100516500005900557520203000616650004802646655002702694700004102721700004802762700004902810700005002859700004602909710005802955856016903013856007803182856015603260994001203416999007903428in0000127563420200904152723.0960411s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34552098  9AGY1288AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34552098  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaS6611 aSmith, Stephen Gregory,d1949-13aAn investigation of motives for birdwatching along the upper Texas Gulf Coast / 1c1993.  axii, 155 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

More specifically, this research seeks to determine whether birders along the upper Texas coast can be segmented into distinct experience groups, and further, whether significant differences exist among the groups in terms of their motives for birding, knowledge and skills in birding, degree of commitment to birding, and preferences for management setting attributes. This study is based on two bodies of previous research. In a series of studies that dealt with various animal activity groups, Stephen Kellert developed a typology of scales to measure American's attitudes toward wildlife. These studies largely were concerned with Americans' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about wildlife and the environment. In this context, Kellert's research yielded insight about many characteristics of birders but left unanswered the question of why people participate in birdwatching. B. L. Driver and his associates have developed standardized scales to measure motives for recreation participation. These scales, called the Recreation Experience Preference (REP) scales, have been validated by a number of subsequent studies. In order to address some of the questions concerning birders, and to extend Kellert's work, the REP scales were used in this study to measure motives for birding and to identify distinct experience groups on the basis of motive differences. The following hypotheses were tested in this study: 1) birders along the upper Texas coast can be divided into distinct, relatively homogeneous segments based on differences in their motives for birding, and 2) each of these segments differs significantly from the others in terms of activities associated with birding, participation in outdoor recreation activities other than birding, preferences for specific managerial settings, and sociodemographic characteristics... 4aMajor recreation and resources development. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aReid, Leslie M.,edegree supervisor.1 aAlbrecht, Don E.,edegree committee member.1 aGramann, James H.,edegree committee member.1 aKing, Lauriston R.,edegree committee member.1 aTeer, James G.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941087841xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1531024zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745532351&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs10056dc4-6d3d-30f6-89d1-5ef1890ea3a1i5a0271e4-7d34-303a-a3c5-eb7555ee2b9404211cam a2200481Ii 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035001400072035002000086035001900106035002300125040004600148049000900194099002900203100003000232245018400262264004800446300004300494336002600537337002800563338002700591500003300618500001000651502002700661504005600688520196200744650002402706650006302730650003302793650003402826650002202860655008302882700004802965700004903013700009403062700009803156700004603254710010503300856015603405856007703561994001203638999007903650in0000005918320220104090721.0800117s1979    txua     bm   000 0 eng d  9AAG8579AM  a(OCoLC)05883115  a(OCoLC)5883115  a(OCoLC)ocm05883115  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdTXAdUtOrBLW  aTXAM  a1979aDissertationaP5631 aPhillips, Sherman Alfred.10aPhysiology of the post-pharyngeal glands and comparative morphology of glands associated with the mouthparts among castes of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren /. 1a[College Station, Tex.] :bPhillips,c1979.  ax, 67 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Major subject: Entomology."  aVita.  cTexas A & M University  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 63-66).3 aMorphology has been determined from serial sectioning and dissections of the post-pharyngeal, maxillary, mandibular, and labial glands of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren. Various parameters such as weight, length, width, and number of lobes of the post-pharyngeal glands, cellular and nuclear diameters of the labial and maxillary glands, length and width of the mandibular glands, and the number of cells of the maxillary glands have been compared and contrasted among castes. Ratios of gland measurements to body length indicate the post-pharyngeal glands are most highly developed in the queen caste. All other glands associated with the mouthparts are most highly developed on a relative size basis in the minum caste and least developed in the queen caste. The lumen of the post-pharyngeal glands of all castes of the red imported fire ant is empty at the time of emergence. After seven days of colony exposure to sugar water, the lumen of the glands remains empty. The glands in all castes are still colorless and flaccid even though the crop is filled with a sugar solution. Only after feeding on materials high in lipid does the lumen become full, acquiring the characteristic turgid, yellow color typical of glands from older worker and reproducer castes. The post-pharyngeal glands selectively absorb and hold lipids from ingested foods for long periods of time. These lipids come from the food only, since the post-pharyngeal glands from queens do not sequester triglycerides or fatty acids from the haemolymph. Lipid classes from the post-pharyngeal glands of worker and queen castes separated by column fractionation are not attractive to members of the colony. Excision of the post-pharyngeal glands from a mated, established queen causes no noticeable change in her behavior or the behavior she elicits from the remainder of the colony. Therefore, the post-pharyngeal glands are not the source of any specific pheromone... 0aFire antsxAnatomy. 0aGlands.0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85055090 0aSolenopsis invictaxAnatomy. 0aSolenopsis richterixAnatomy. 4aMajor entomology. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf20140260391 aKeeley, Larry L.,edegree committee member.1 aMerkle, Morris G.,edegree committee member.1 aMorgan, Page W.,edegree committee member.0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n906579111 aPlapp, Frederick W.,edegree committee member.0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n851594641 aVinson, S.

Initiation of improvements in power output capacity will first involve identifying individual weaknesses in specific power parameters. This study was proposed to evaluate variations in power output between selected subjects. Characteristics of aerobic endurance and muscular strength were also examined for possible relationships to power parameters. Fifty-one male students aged 17-24 served as subjects in this investigation and were tested on three different occasions for predicted maximal oxygen uptake (predicted Vo2), isokinetic strength, and short-term power output. Pearson correlation and analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures were performed on subject data (N=51) to examine power parameters. Peak power (PP) correlated with both average power (AP) and power decline (PD) while PD correlated positively with AP and negatively with time to peak power (TTPP) (p<0.05). Operationally defined groups of high and low PP differed significantly with regard to AP and PD means and operationally defined groups of high and low PD differed significantly with regard to TTPP means. Extension strength, predicted Vo2, and selected power variables were also evaluated by Pearson correlation procedures. AP and PP were both found to correlate significantly with slow extension strength (SEXT), fast extension strength (FEXT), and predicted Vo2. ANOVA procedures were then performed for SEXT, FEXT, and predicted Vo2 with regard to PP and AP levels. Findings suggested that subjects grouped high in PP and AP have similarly high extension strength capabilities. Based on the results of this investigation, it was concluded that there are differences in power parameters between selected subjects. Also, subjects grouped high in PP and AP were stronger and had greater PD. 0aCycling. 0aBiomechanics. 0aPhysical fitnessxTesting. 4aMajor physical education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBarnes, William S.,edegree supervisor.1 aAnderson, James,edegree committee member.1 aCrouse, Stephen,edegree committee member.1 aTolson, Homer,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1274308zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745948911&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs96f33b30-4575-357b-85ad-f2871cc59c26i5ab53543-6f5a-3af6-a9a8-e68b3da44a8903223ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099003000180100003700210245010100247264001000348300004500358336002600403337002800429338002700457504004100484500001000525502004100535500003200576520139400608650002102002655002702023700004402050700005102094700004902145700005502194710005802249856016902307856007802476856015602554994001202710999007902722in0000128772220200904152706.0960329s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34490771  9AGX7149AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34490771  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG64231 aGonzalez-Martin, Anuncia,d1963-10aIn Situ studies of the determination of surface states at the semiconductor/solution interface / 1c1993.  axv, 332 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

STM was proven to be a valuable technique in the determination of surface states in the semiconductor/solution interface. Here, a model was developed to characterize the electron tunneling process between the tip and the semiconductor. The effect of an oxide film on the electrode surface was considered. On the other hand, investigations using SBGP spectroscopy in the IR region considerably increased the resolvability of the energy range in which surface states can be determined. A surface state band was located at about 0.3 eV above the top of the valency band at the surface of the semiconductor. This band of surface states was induced in the oxide/solution interface. The dependence of both the energy position and density of surface states on the electrode potential and electrolyte strongly suggests that surface states were induced by adsorption of H atoms (an intermediate on the H, evolution reaction) on the electrode surface. Comparison between the dependence of both the H coverage and the density of surface states with the electrode potential supports the concept that surface states arise as a consequence of H adsorption. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBockris, John O'M.,edegree supervisor.1 aClearfield, Abraham,edegree committee member.1 aConway, Dwight C.,edegree committee member.1 aSrinivasan, Supramaniam,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941078041xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1526974zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745760101&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6a19ce7f-fe74-31d2-a28a-9e8537537c0ei5b23c481-acc3-3915-b8a2-824495bb520c02624ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002700218245009300245264001000338300002600348336002600374337002800400338002700428504004100455500001000496502004100506500003400547500003700581520087500618650001601493650002001509650002201529650002301551655002701574700003801601700005301639700004701692700004401739710005801783856007801841856015601919994001202075999007902087in0000123298120200904152648.0950426s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32372507  9AGS2365AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32372507  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaB1461 aBagley, Scott William.10aPolynomial near-rings, distributor and J2 ideals of generalized centralizer near-rings / 1c1993.  av, 55 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

This new near-ring is by definition different from the class of com position polynomial near-lings. In the second part, we determine the J2-radieal and the distributor ideal of generalized centralizer near-rings. Some comparisons of the two are also included.

The structure-function relationship o f OPH was investigated utilizing a variety o f substrates with diverse side chains and leaving groups. The results demonstrated that the side chains greatly affected the catalytic efficiency o f OPH. The selected organophosphorothioates were hydrolyzed by OPH at varied rates, indicated by reaction with 5,5'-dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid. The hydrolytic reaction, inhibition o f acetylcholinesterase activity and paraoxon hydrolysis were further characterized with demeton-S.

The kinetics and the metal contents o f purified and the reconstituted enzym es were determined.

Current industrial alkylations use either H2SO4 or HF as a catalyst. Compared to the liquid catalyst, the use of a solid acid catalyst tremendously reduces or eliminates the potential hazard of large acid spills. In this study, a HY zeolite, sulfate-promoted titania, mixed oxide of TiO2/ZrO2, TiO2/Al2O3, and ZrO2 were synthesized. Two different sulfate-promoted zirconias, (MSG-ZrO2-S and PPT-ZrO2-S) were synthesized by the modified sol gel method and the precipitation method. The alkylation results indicated MSG-ZrO2-S had a significant larger butene conversion, C8 yield, and C8/C9 + ratio than PPT-ZrO2-S. MSG-ZrO2-S also had a larger C8/C9+ ratio than HY. MSG-TiO2-S and its related binary oxide were not active. MSG-ZrO2-S had more acid sites over the entire acidity range than PPT-ZrO2 -S. Compared to HY, MSG-ZrO2-S has a fewer number of weak and medium acid sites, as well as a greater number of strong acid sites. MSG-Ti02-S had the smallest amount of acid sites indicated by the ammonia TPD analysis. The reaction temperature significantly affected alkylation activity of HY. Butene conversion, C5+ yield, and n-butane production were dramatically increased with the increase of temperature with the decrease of C8/C9+. Isobutane to butene ratio had no significant effect on alkylation. A larger isobutane to butene ratio, however, was more favorable for the production of C8 than the production of light ends. All active catalysts used in this study showed rapid deactivation. The cause of deactivation is believed to be the deposit of polymer on the active sites. The experimental data obtained from HY-catalyzed alkylation were well fitted by the simulated results based on a simplified kinetic model. All 16 parameters used in the kinetic model were evaluated through the parameter estimation. 0aAlkylation. 0aButenexReactivity. 0aHydrocarbons. 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAnthony, Rayford G.,edegree supervisor.1 aGadalla, Ahmed M.,edegree committee member.1 aLunsford, Jack H.,edegree committee member.1 aPloehn, Harry J.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941129741xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1482000zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745762151&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd3ccc063-b1f5-39ba-802d-e6a1fc1fa01ai5c63c5cc-16a7-3770-8818-3d7aa050031903785ctm a2200493Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040007500109035002000184050002400204049000900228099002900237100003600266245009300302264001000395300004500405336002600450337002800476338002700504504004100531500001000572502004100582500004300623520169900666650002102365650002302386650002402409650002202433650003502455650003202490655002702522700004802549700004702597700004802644700004702692710005802739856016902797856007802966856015603044994001203200999007903212in0000127517020200904152648.0960322s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34433795  9AGX3720AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdNQAdOCLCOdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdTXA  a(OCoLC)34433795 4aLB1067.5b.A86 1993  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaA8491 aAsoodeh, Mohammad Mehdi,d1961-10aStatic visuals vs. computer animation used in the development of spatial visualization / 1c1993.  axi, 114 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

A course in this area of study is mainly concerned with the development of spatial cognition of the students enrolled. Various tools and techniques have been and are currently being employed to accomplish the task. These tools are utilized as external stimuli that help students in developing a mental process essential for visualizing the objects in an engineering system. Previous research indicated that the methods currently utilized may not be sufficient, and other techniques such as the use of computer animation may be useful in delivering such instruction dealing with spatial abilities. A sample of 110 students was selected from the population of 1075 students enrolled in ENDG-105 (Engineering Design Graphics) at Texas A&M University during the Spring Semester, 1993. The sample was divided into two comparison groups. One group received instruction via animation and the other group received instruction via static visuals. The same procedures and equipment were used for both groups. The analyses of the results revealed that the group that received instruction via animation performed generally better on the Mental Rotation Test, quizzes, and assignments than the static group. The results of the Mental Rotation Test seemed to indicate the effectiveness of animation in developing spatial visualization skills. It was recommended that the technologies (equipment and techniques), utilized in this study, be used in producing presentations utilizing computer generated dynamic graphics for incorporation into the current classroom presentation methods. 0aVisual learning. 0aComputer graphics. 0aComputer animation. 0aSpace perception. 0aComputer-assisted instruction. 4aMajor industrial education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHouseholder, Daniel L.,edegree supervisor.1 aBaker, Glenn E.,edegree committee member.1 aClark, Donald L.,edegree committee member.1 aEarle, James H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941070441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1523686zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745528251&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs783845b2-5ed0-35ab-842a-51c87cdf9844i5c738eac-5ed5-3b5f-ac54-76d706377cfb03588ctm a22003375a 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002000072035001400092037001800106040002200124049001500146099003000161100002900191245010200220264008100322300004600403336002600449337002800475338002700503504004100530500001000571502004000581500003200621530006100653520229400714650002103008856013303029999000903162999007903171in0000130704620190325093122.0960614s1994    xx a     b    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)34932131  9AHA7925AM  a95-20302bUMI  aTXAcTXAdUtOrBLW  aTXAMaTXAR  a1994aDissertationaA54721 aAnderson, Louis Charles.10aFormation of gas-phase hydroxyl radicals over metal oxide catalysts /cby Louis Charles Anderson. 1a[Place of publication not identified] :b[publisher not identified] ;c1994.  axii, 87 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The OH- radicals were detected by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy.  The ability of different types of metal oxides to produce gas-phase OH- radicals during the reaction of 0, with H 2 0 was examined. Surface-generated gas-phase hydroxyl radicals were formed at temperatures between 983 and 1250 K over 7 mg La 2 0 3 during the reactions of CH4+02, CH 4 +N2O and H 2 0+0 2' The activation energy for the production of hydroxyl radicals during these three reactions was approximately 40 kcal/mol.  It was determined that the OH- radicals were actually formed from the reaction 1/2H 2 0+1/40 2 @ OH-.  Evidence for the reaction being at equilibrium includes (i) the activation energy for hydroxyl radical production was equal to the heat of formation of OH- radicals from H,O with 0,; (ii) the orders of OH- radical production were those expected from the law of mass action; and (iii) the absolute concentration of hydroxyl radicals was the same as that calculated from thermodynamics. The production of OH, radicals was investigated over other rare earth oxides catalysts.  The strongly basic rare earth oxides, including La203, and Nd 203) produced hydroxyl radicals at equilibrium with 7 mtorr each of H2 0 and 0 2 and 7 mg catalyst at 1220 K. These catalysts also produced significant concentrations of methyl radicals during methane oxidative coupling.  The weakly basic rare earth oxides, Yb 203 and CeO2), did not produce any detectable hydroxyl radicals or any significant concentration of methyl radicals during methane oxidative coupling. The production of OH- radicals became kinetically controlled at higher pressures or when the amount of catalyst was decreased. The OH- radical production became zero order for both H,O and 0, and had an activation energy of 10 kcal/mol at pressures over 200 mtorr for a 1: I water-to-oxygen ratio.  When the amount of La 203 catalyst was less than 2 mg, the activation energy decreased from 45 kcal/i-mol to 31 kcal/mol as the total pressure was increased froi- n 50 mtorr to 120 mtorr.  At pressures below 50 mtorr the orders were 0.47 and 1.02 for 0, and H,O, respectively. 4aMajor chemistry.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741964831&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aMARSffsfc2892ac-42b9-397c-9f1b-dc36e5cc1456i5c755ed0-e526-3f4c-92ea-6fd618f2418b04125ctm a2200505Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005800109035002000167043001200187049000900199099002900208100002500237245005500262264001000317300005000327336002600377337002800403338002700431504004100458500001000499502004100509500003700550520217000587650003102757650003602788650002202824650002702846650003402873650002602907650005002933651003702983655002703020700004303047700004803090700004803138700005003186710005803236856007803294856015603372994001203528999007903540in0000120363320200904152627.0941109s1992    xx ab    bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31431564  9AGP1423AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)31431564  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaL8481 aLong, David William.10aExtrapolation of point data for resource mapping / 1c1992.  aix, 94 leaves :billustrations, maps ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Even small scale imagery such as advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) has been applied to continental vegetation mapping. Much has been written about how remote sensing can provide this kind of data for a GIS, however, little attention has been placed on the role of GIS for supplying data to automate the image classification process. Large data bases such as the USDA SCS National Resources Inventory (NRI) now being constructed have a potential for filling this role. The NRI has a potential for contributing to the improvement of vegetation mapping in at least three ways: Automated classification of imagery using NRI sample points to create training sets, classification verification through use of NRI sample points as field verification points, and automated map generation directly from the NRI data base through use of Thiessen polygons. Classification accuracy of a TM scene classified using NRI data to produce training sets was fair (43.6% overall classification accuracy), considering the process was completely automated with no human judgement involved. Adding ancillary data and temporal image information should improve this figure. Classification accuracy was tested for training sets of various sized polygons constructed around the NRI points. It was found that the smallest polygon (3x3 box) around each point resulted in a training set that produced the most accurate classification. Land use/land cover m aps can be easily generated from the NRI data base using the Thiessen polygon process. They provide a good overview of the conditions for a large area such as a state, however, for a county sized map, there are too few NRI data points to allow a reasonable depiction of the true conditions. Thiessen polygon maps do not depict accurate boundaries due to the process used for polygon generation, however, with the large number of sample points in the NRI, they provide a quick approximation of the conditions and have a potential for displaying land use/land cover change as the NRI is updated every five years. 0aVegetation mappingzTexas. 0aGeographic information systems. 0aVoronoi polygons. 0aRemote-sensing images. 0aSpatial analysis (Statistics) 4aMajor forest science. 7aVegetation mapping.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01164940 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMaggio, Robert C.,edegree supervisor.1 aBaker, Robert D.,edegree committee member.1 aEriksson, Marian,edegree committee member.1 aWhittaker, Dale A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1447512zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746518071&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs8ce00d6d-32ed-3898-bcd1-d0a9c4c52d59i5ca39203-1796-33ef-90cd-f6351b97aaa902725ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100003200197245011000229264001000339300002900349336002600378337002800404338002700432504004100459500001000500502004100510500004900551520106000600650004201660655002701702700004901729700005201778700004901830700005301879710005801932856007801990856015602068994001202224999007902236in0000127216020200904152645.0960222s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34242868  9AGW7865AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34242868  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaA4281 aAllen, Olivia Kokko,d1949-14aThe relationship of interdisciplinary teaching to achievement and motivation in precalculus and physics / 1c1993.  avii, 101 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

In this traveling wave photodetector structure the incident light interacts continuously with the optically generated microwave signal while they propagate along their own waveguides. Therefore, when the phases between the optical and microwave signals are matched, a strong traveling wave signal can be detected without losing its high speed and high quantum efficiency. Two types of photoconductive TWPDs, that is, symmetrical and asymmetrical TWPDs, are studied in this dissertation. DC and RF characterizations are carried out for these devices. Also, the interference effects are investigated with multiple input beams.  Since these TWPDs have planar structures, it is easy to integrate the TWPDs with other elements in Microwave and Millimeter wave Hybrid (MIC) and Monolithic (MMIC) Integrated Circuits such as GaAs Field-Effect Transistors (GaAs FETs). In this dissertation, an optical receiver is constructed by hybrid integration of the TWPD with a commercial low noise GaAs FET amplifier. A network, to match device impedances to the appropriate source or load impedances are designed and fabricated in microstrip on a semi-insulating GaAs substrate.  Microwave ring resonators for optoelectronic application are designed using CAD tools such as LINECALC and TOUCHSTONE, fabricated in our laboratory using photolithography process, and optically characterized using a modulated laser diode light source and a spectrum analyzer. A microstrip ring resonator and a new type of CPW-to-Slotline ring resonator monolithically integrated with a Schottky photodetector are investigated for optical excitation and nonlinear behavior. Harmonic signals are generated by optical excitation of the resonators at the fundamental mode. By mixing a local microwave signal with an optically generated RF signal in the vicinity of resonant frequencies of the resonator, new signals, which contain the sum and difference frequency of the two input signals, are generated. Also, nonlinear parametric amplification of optical RF input signal is investigated in both of the ring resonators with a local microwave pump signal. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf2014026039 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aTaylor, H.

The study was an attempt to answer the following research question: Is there any difference between the observed and expected values in regard to health education perceptions in terms of ethnicity? The null hypothesis of the study was that there would be no significant differences between the observed and expected values in regard to health education perceptions in terms of ethnicity. The study was conducted between September and December, 1992. The sampling plan employed was the utilization of a proportional stratified sampling of the base population. The villages, where the data were collected, were randomly selected. Questionnaires were utilized for data collection. A return rate of 99.08 percent was obtained. Analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). The Chi Square procedure was utilized to test the null hypothesis. Alpha was set a priori at 0.05. Overall Chi Square was reported in terms of ethnicity. Percentages were utilized to explain differences by gender and by age groups. The null hypothesis was rejected when the overall Chi Square was significant. The findings were discussed and generalized conclusions were reported. A reversal of response pattern either within an ethnic group or between ethnic groups was believed to be practically important to the health educator. As such, the practical importance of each difference was reported. Also, recommendations were made based on the practical importance. Those differences in perceptions with practical importance to health educators were related to the following topics: polygamy, nutrition, birth control, abortions, homosexuality, lesbianism, alcohol abuse, marijuana use, airborne diseases, sexually transmissible diseases, heart disease, premarital sexual intercourse, large families, exercises and disease prevention, dehydration, vertical transmission of diseases, importance of health education messages, choice between cultural beliefs and practices when there was conflict with health education messages, and alcohol consumption. 4aMajor health education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBallard, Danny,edegree supervisor.1 aHurley, Robert S.,edegree supervisor.1 aReilley, Robert,edegree committee member.1 aTolson, Homer,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1518236zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744716041&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2e8ab75a-a0b6-3b99-bbcb-27c24e498e72i5d1415cc-26aa-3c5f-b911-803ce190f72704109ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002800197245012600225264001000351300004700361336002600408337002800434338002700462504004100489500001000530502004100540500004500581520230100626650003402927655002702961700004102988700004403029700004603073700005203119710005803171856015603229856007803385856013303463994001203596999007903608in0000129947320200904152730.0960605s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34872449  9AHA6248AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34872449  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaK1431 aKalpathi, Ramani Raman.10aInductance and active phase vector based torque control for Switched Reluctance Motor drives /cby Ramani Raman Kalpathi. 1c1994.  axiii, 119 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The simplicity in both motor design and power converter requirement along with the availability of high frequency, high power semiconductor switches have made SRMs compete with conventional adjustable speed drive technologies. The subject of winding current control in switched reluctance machines has always been associated with the shaft position information. The use of inductance for direct commutation control is the central subject of this dissertation. In contrast to the conventional methods based on position commutation, new methods of control based on inductance commutation are presented.  The object of a commutation algorithm is to switch the currents in the phase coils, in order to provide continuous energy conversion with maximum torque output for a given unit of input current. Since torque production in a SRM is based on the concept of variable reluctance, it makes more sense to observe the instantaneous phase inductance or reluctance instead of estimating the rotor position. The inductance sensors observe the machine parameters and provide sufficient information on the electrical characteristics of the coils. This control strategy avoids the inductance to position transformation blocks conventionally used in SRM control systems. In a typical SRM, the phase coils have a nonlinear behavior of inductance due to effects of current saturation. Also the parameters of one phase coil differ from those of the other due to manufacturing tolerances or due to bearing wear. In such cases, the algorithms written during the stage of manufacturing may not be valid after parameter changes. Optimizing torque production in the event of phase asymmetry and saturation is developed in this research.  Indirect sensors connected to the active phase coil of the SRM are based on sensing the flux level in the active coil. New commutation algorithms based on flux sensing concepts are derived and commutation based on observable phase coil parameters are developed. The commutation methods are based on a composite vector of the observable parameters of the active phase coil. These methods work on a tabular approach which is ideal for implementation using digital computers. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aEhsani, Mehrdad,edegree supervisor.1 aRussell, Don,edegree committee member.1 aEnjeti, Prasad,edegree committee member.1 aSeyed-Yagoobi, Jamal,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741325001&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554788zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741325001&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs2a43907d-b8ca-30b2-b5d3-a568ae7c80f6i5ec40f4c-47b3-3b44-b21e-8275a9b2526003933ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100003800217245008100255264001000336300002800346336002600374337002800400338002700428500002800455502004100483500001000524504004100534500003200575520216300607650003302770650003602803650002202839650002102861655002702882700004202909700004902951700004503000700004703045710005803092856007803150856015603228994001203384999007903396in0000117296720200904152617.0940119s1992    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm29648958  9AGE5994AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)29648958  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaE461 aElliff, Connie Jo Swenson,d1951-10aBody composition, dietary intake, and energy expenditure in pregnant women / 1c1992.  aix, 125 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Subjects were measured during gestational weeks 12-13, 25-26, 37-38, and 6-12 wk postpartum (n=5 NW, 4 OW for 12-13 wk measurement; n=9 NW, 7 OW for other measurement periods). Self-reported prepregnancy weights were 58.6 ± 5.3 and 81.2 ± 14.0 kg for NW and OW groups, respectively. Prepregnancy body mass indices were 21.4 ± 1.6 for NW subjects and 28.7 ± 3.6 for OW women. No differences were observed between groups for any aspect of pregnancy outcome. Mean weight gains were 14.7 ± 3.6 and 14.5 ± 9.1 for NW and OW groups, respectively. Maternal weight gain was correlated neither with energy intake nor infant birth weight. Differences among skinfold thickness at the various measurement periods were not statistically significant. In the NW group, sum of the triceps, biceps, and subscapular skinfold thicknesses tended to increase substantially in the 2nd trimester, with a smaller increase in the 3rd trimester, and to decrease postpartum. For the OW group, the tendency was for the sum of the skinfolds to increase slightly in the 2nd trimester and decrease in late pregnancy. Percentage body fat and body fat mass estimated by underwater weighing were higher (p < 0.001) at all measurement periods than estimates based on skinfold measurements. Body fat percentages changed significantly over the measurement periods. Body fat mass, based on skinfold measurements, increased significantly between wk 12-13 and 25-2 6. Body fat mass tended to increase slightly between wk 25-26 and 37-38 for the NW group and decline slightly for the OW subjects. Neither energy intake nor activity patterns differed significantly between groups or among time periods. The tendency was for the OW women to be more sedentary than the NW group. The study represents the first report of a longitudinal comparison of NW and OW pregnant women. Trends indicate that there may be differences between responses of NW and OW women with regard to energy balance during pregnancy. 0aPregnant womenxWeight gain. 0aPregnancyxNutritional aspects. 0aBody composition. 4aMajor nutrition. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKubena, Karen S.,edegree supervisor.1 aLupton, Joanne R.,edegree committee member.1 aTolson, Homer,edegree committee member.1 aWylie, Wayne E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1365919zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744912791&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs039516d0-6ee9-34f4-8403-ba1610b65b92i5f10fae2-da14-3b5b-9a4d-2bbeb5ad6bde03565ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006100109035002000170049000900190099002900199100003400228245008500262264001000347300004600357336002600403337002800429338002700457500002800484502004100512500001000553504004100563500003000604520161500634650002602249650000902275650002302284650002002307655002702327700004102354700004802395700005102443700004902494710005802543856016902601856007802770856015602848994001203004999007903016in0000104990320200904152525.0911206s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24902283  9AFJ8155AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)24902283  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaM6211 aMichaelson, Martin J.,d1961-12aA survey of DNA content variation and its molecular basis in Helianthus annuus / 1c1990.  aviii, 62 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

There have been several reports of variation in nuclear DNA content within Helianthus annuus (2C=3.57 pg to 2C=9.90 pg). One group has attributed this in part to the loss of chromosomes during somatic development (aneusomaty). The objectives of this study were to: 1. develop a highly sensitive flow cytometric method to measure plant nuclear DNA content, and to quantify the extent of nuclear DNA content variation found in the cultivated sunflower, H. annuus; 2. resolve contradictions in measured DNA content of H. annuus reported in the literature, using this system; 3. determine if chromosome number varies in H. annuus somatic tissues (using root tip tissue), as has been reported; and 4. identify specific DNA sequences responsible for DNA content variation in H. annuus. In this study nuclear DNA variation was quantified in 14 lines of H. annuus using laser flow cytometry and, for some lines, Feulgen microspectrophotometry as well. DNA values varied at least 32% between line means. One line showed intralinear variation in DNA content of 19.08%, and leaf-to-leaf variation as high as 44.65% was found in two. No evidence of somatic chromosome number variation was observed. Copy number of seven repeated sequences (including ribosomal and histone probes) was determined in six H. annuus lines with varying DNA content; the copy number of some of these sequences were found to be correlated with DNA content variation. 0aSunflowersxGenetics. 0aDNA. 0aPlantsxVariation. 4aMajor genetics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPrice, H.

Nuclear fuel management problems are quite formidable due to the many fuel arrangement options available. Therefore, an engineer must perform multigroup diffusion calculations for a variety of different strategies in order to determine an optimum core reload. Standard fine mesh finite difference codes result in a considerable computational cost. A better approach is to build upon the proven reliability of currently available mainframe computer programs, and improve the engineering efficiency by taking advantage of the most useful characteristic of workstations: enhanced man/machine interaction. This dissertation contains a description of the methods and a user's guide for the interactive fuel cycle scoping program, SunFast. SunFast provides computational speed and accuracy of solution along with a synergetic coupling between the user and the machine. It should prove to be a valuable tool when extensive sets of similar calculations must be done at a low cost, as is the case for assessing fuel management strategies. 0aNuclear engineeringxComputer programs. 0aNuclear fuelsxManagement. 0aNuclear reactors. 4aMajor nuclear engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aParish, Theodore A.,edegree supervisor.1 aNelson, Paul,edegree committee member.1 aPilant, Michael S.,edegree committee member.1 aSchlapper, Gerald A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913391441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1207729zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747411731&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsa52dab93-2374-31f4-84c2-52a635e097dci5f9a5388-8526-3137-8523-45b14c4b10d404116ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100004300209245010200252264001000354300004400364336002600408337002800434338002700462504004100489500001000530502004100540500003500581650002400616655002700640700004600667700005000713700005500763700004600818710005800864856016900922856007801091520227801169856015603447994001203603999007903615in0000127256320200904152720.0960410s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34542433  9AGY1018AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34542433  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaR4361 aRestrepo-Hartwig, Maria Amelia,d1953-10aSubcellular partitioning and regulation of nuclear transport of tobacco etch potyvirus proteins / 1c1993.  ax, 129 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

From the earliest time points at which the proteins were detected, the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro), and cylindrical inclusion protein (Cl) were localized in the cytoplasm. The VPg/proteinase (NIa) and the catalytic subunit of the polymerase (Nib) accumulated in the nucleus. The sequence for the reporter protein β-glucuronidase (GUS) was fused to the sequences for NIa or NIb in a plant expression vector, resulting in synthesis of chimeric proteins in transfected protoplasts and transgenic plants. Both proteins mediated nuclear translocation of GUS, indicating that they have independent nuclear localization signals. To understand the factors that regulate the nuclear transport of NIa, transgenic plants that express genes encoding GUS fused to NIa or the 6/NIa polyprotein were generated. When located in a 6-kDa protein/NIa polyprotein, the 6-kDa protein impeded the nuclear translocation of NIa. The presence of free 6-kDa protein had no effect on NIa-mediated translocation. The 6-kDa protein and three polyproteins containing the 6- kDa protein were identified by affinity chromatography in extracts from infected plants. Two of these polyproteins contained NIa or the N-terminal domain of NIa (VPg). The subcellular localization properties of the 6-kDa protein were investigated by fractionation and immunolocalization of tissues from transgenic plants expressing 6-kDa protein/GUS fusion proteins. The GUS activity was detected in the cytosolic fraction (S30) of extracts derived from transgenic plants expressing non-fused GUS, while GUS activity was detected in the crude membrane fraction (P30) of extracts derived from transgenic plants expressing 6/GUS or GUS/6 fusion proteins. Transgenic plants expressing a GUS/6 fusion protein developed mitochondrial aggregates, and cytoplasmic membranous proliferations around and extending from the nucleus. The 6-kDa protein accumulated in these novel structures. The data presented in this dissertation suggest that differential processing and subcellular accumulation of proteins may be the mechanism by which potyviruses regulate the effective amounts of active replication proteins.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745760441&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2750940f-9cc5-3140-9086-a35bcc96e85di6074f52f-f86e-3e9a-9db0-a005a5d0932503902ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002800168100002800196245009200224264001000316300004600326336002600372337002800398338002700426504004100453500001000494502004100504500004400545520213900589650003302728655002702761700004502788700004602833700004102879700004402920710005802964856015603022856007803178856013303256994001203389999007903401in0000129946620200904152731.0960605s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34872337  9AHA6241AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34872337  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaK251 aKeating, James Francis.10aSimulation of paraffin deposition and removal in wellbores /cby James Francis Keating. 1c1994.  axii, 120 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

This is believed to be the first such simulator. To model paraffin deposition in the production tubing, a reservoir simulator is needed to accurately feed paraffinic oil into the annulus and the production tubing. A reservoir simulator that was developed by Ring was used. This simulator was modified and linked to an overburden and a wellbore simulators by using the principle of domain decomposition. By linking these three simulators, paraffin deposition is in the tubing was modelled. The removal of deposited paraffin was studied with one of the folowing three thermal methods: (1) a downhole heater, (2) the electric heating of the tubing, or (3) hot oil injection. To model these thermal removal methods, energy is added to the wellbore simulator in different manners each of which mimics one of the removal methods. Four cases, one depositional and three removal, are documented to illustrate the results obtained from this simulator. The conclusions were made by running the four cases and by developing the simulator. The following conclusions were made by running the four cases: (1) most of the precipitated paraffin is produced with the oil, (2) hot oil injected into the annulus may flow into the formation and reduce its effective permeability, however some damage may be removed by producing undersaturated oil, (3) downhole heaters take several hours to remove deposited paraffin near the surface and (4) electric heating of the tubing is a viable thermal removal process. The following conclusion were made by developing the simulator: (1) To thermally remove paraffin in a paraffinic black oil reserboir simulator, the variable cloud point problem must be modeled, and (2) the principle of domain decomposition can be effectively used to link a wellbore simulator to a reservoir and overburden simulator. 4aMajor petroleum engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWattenbarger, R.

The dynamics of the system considered is modelled with as little simplifications and assumptions as possible to keep the problem tractable and at the same time physically realistic. Effects of geometric nonlinearity is taken into account. The hybrid governing equations are discretized by using the Galerkin's method. The flexible tether is also modelled as a series of beads which are connected in series by massless springs. Several tension and reel rate feedback control laws for deployment and retrieval are designed using Lyapunov's method when flexibility of the tether is neglected. It was found that the tension control laws designed for the simplified system can have a stabilizing effect on the vibrations of the tether. The performance of the full dynamic system with the designed control laws is investigated via simulations using both the Galerkin and bead model. At the same time, observations regarding the dynamics of the system and the validity of using the Galerkin's discretization procedure for a variable length tether are investigated. It is shown that the effects of geometric nonlinearity is significant during retrieval and that when geometric nonlinearity is included, an artificial instability is introduced into the Galerkin model causing sudden divergence of the system response during retrieval. This behavior is reproduced even for a simplified two dimensional example problem. It was found that the bead model produces a response that is physically realistic. Simulation studies using the bead model show that when reel rate control laws are used, vibrations grow to the point where the system becomes unstable. However, the tension control laws successfully retrieve the tethered subsatellite and were found to be effective in damping the elastic longitudinal vibrations in the early stages of retrieval. A nonrecursive order-N method for efficiently simulating the bead model is also introduced. The feasibility of implementing the order-N method for parallel computation is investigated using two parallel computer architectures. It was found that, due mostly to communication time, the use of the parallel computers do not offer any improvement in overall computation time. 0aTethered satellites. 0aSpace vehiclesxControl systems. 0aSpace vehiclesxDynamics. 4aMajor aerospace engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aVadali, Srinivas R.,edegree supervisor.1 aHuang, Garng M.,edegree committee member.1 aJunkins, John L.,edegree committee member.1 aKurdila, Andrew J.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932875241xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1479204zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747728711&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs3091d7c6-009c-396d-80ca-c972b31038ffi62b10efc-f377-379f-9728-b32dff56480f04325ctm a2200541Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005800109035002000167043001200187049000900199099002800208100002400236245013000260264001000390300002800400336002600428337002800454338002700482504004100509500001000550502004100560500004500601520201500646650005002661650006602711650003302777650002502810650003402835650005202869650005502921650004402976650008403020651003703104655004403141655002703185700004203212700004703254700005103301700004803352710005803400856007803458856015603536994001203692999007903704in0000123379320200904152718.0950712s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32807284  9AGT4198AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)32807284  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaQ341 aQueen, Kay Wallace.14aThe academic, creative, and social performance of six at-risk adolescents who participated in an alternative school program / 1c1993.  aix, 193 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The literature addresses defining the at-risk problem, the consequences of the problem, and solutions to the problem. This research explores the impact on the students who attended an alternative school that individualized instruction by implementing cooperative learning, peer tutoring, and the use of simulations. The study unfolded in three phases: a) Phase I, collection and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative data related to the characteristics of the school and the student body; b) Phase II, examination of the implementation of the three innovative instructional strategies during one academic year, verbal portrayal of the environment and events of the year; and c) Phase III, the development of case studies of six former students. Four research questions sought to determine the effects of the school on the students in the areas of academic performance, development of creativity, social performance, and residual effects of the school. Findings presented are based on students' performance at entry into the program, during attendance at the school, and two years after leaving the program. The findings indicate that the academic performance of the students did improve while they attended the school. The development or enhancement of creativity was supported by events during the year and by the creative endeavors of the students today. The results of the study indicate that the social performance of the students improved in the areas of contact with law enforcement agencies and communicating with others while they were attending the school. Regarding the residual effects of the school, the students overwhelmingly stated that the school had made a positive impact on their lives today. They attributed this to the caring and concern of the teachers and staff of the school rather than to the innovative instructional strategies. 0aEducational innovationszTexasvCase studies. 0aYouth with social disabilitiesxEducation (Secondary)zTexas. 0aEducation, SecondaryzTexas. 0aFree schoolszTexas. 4aMajor educational psychology. 7aEducation, Secondary.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00903252 7aEducational innovations.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00903483 7aFree schools.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00933926 7aYouth with social disabilitiesxEducation (Secondary)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01183669 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aCase studies.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423765 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aNash, William R.,edegree supervisor.1 aAsh, Michael J.,edegree committee member.1 aErlandson, David A.,edegree committee member.1 aRieber, Lloyd P.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1486827zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744716241&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6ebb522d-7b0e-35d4-905e-84c883093c4ai635c34c5-7fb6-356a-b4de-24998641e7cb03607ctm a2200445Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040009600109035002000205049000900225099002900234100003100263245004700294264001000341300002900351336002600380337002800406338002700434504004100461500001000502502004100512500003000553520185800583600003302441600003202474600003102506650001902537655002702556700004402583700005102627700005102678700004902729710005802778856007802836856015602914994001203070999007903082in0000125806720200904152722.0960223s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34260207  9AGW8144AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdLWUdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCAdOCLdOCLCOdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)34260207  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaS3581 aSchnebly, Cynthia Woodard.10aRepetition in Beckett, Pinter, and Albee / 1c1993.  avii, 186 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

One of the key features in both everyday conversation and the dramatic conversation in the Theater of the Absurd is repetition. In the plays of Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, and Edward Albee, repetition is a central stylistic feature of the dialogue. It operates on two levels in their texts: the micro level, between the characters, and the macro level, between the performance or text and the audience/reader. On both levels repetition creates both harmony and disharmony. On the micro level, repetition functions to create meaning and promote interaction between the characters, but it also signals discord between characters as well, because they use repetition to evade giving pertinent responses, to verbally dominate other characters, and to show contrived involvement. On the macro level, repetition creates harmony by involving us emotionally in the musical patterns of the dialogue, by bonding with the repetition of our everyday speech to produce dialogue that feels comfortable, and by making us laugh. Yet, repetition on the macro level also creates disharmony through too much repetition, or noise, and repetition that illustrates communication systems in a state of collapse. Repetition in the dialogue mimics the repetitive nature of ordinary talk and makes dialogue that should feel comfortable seem threatening, and it unsettles the spectator/reader because it captures our ambivalence about the communication process. What the spectator/reader remembers from this dialogue is not the rapport building nature of repetition but repetition that creates more distance between interlocutors in conversation, that feigns conversational involvement but actually brings anxiety.10aBeckett, Samuel,d1906-1989.10aPinter, Harold,d1930-2008.10aAlbee, Edward,d1928-2016. 4aMajor English. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aJohnstone, Barbara,edegree supervisor.1 aFlorez-Tighe, Viola,edegree committee member.1 aKelly, Katherine E.,edegree committee member.1 aNewton, Robert D.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1518535zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744720311&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs84084472-adf2-365e-a4a5-84eaaea87faei64b04c60-4385-3afb-8771-3e75b39746f603682ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100002200217245024700239264001000486300004600496336002600542337002800568338002700596504004100623500001000664502004100674500003200715520174700747650001702494650002802511650002602539650002402565650001702589650002102606655002702627700003802654700005002692700004302742700004402785710005802829856007802887856015602965994001203121999007903133in0000120452320200904152632.0941116s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31469132  9AGP2421AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31469132  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaO991 aOzaki, Shin-Ichi.10aOverexpression, purification, and characterization of the Pseudomonas denitrificans and Salmonella typhimurium gene products in vitamin B12 biosynthesis, structural analysis of vitamin B12 intermediates, and enzymatic synthesis of factor S3 / 1c1992.  axiii, 99 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The functions of P. denitrificans cobI and S. typhimurium cbiL gene products were defined as S-adenosyl methionine dependent methyltransferases catalyzing C-20 methylation of precorrin-2 respectively. The S. typhimurium cbiA gene product was characterized as adenosyl triphosphate dependent cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase. It was proved that the S. typhimurium cbiF gene product catalyzes C-16 methylation of trimethylpyrrocorphin I to afford metal-free factor S3. Zinc insertion into the macrocycle took place non-enzymatically to produce factor S3, the zinc complex of a tetramethylated derivative of uroporphyrinogen I. The structures of precorrin-2, precorrin-3, factor II, factor III (intermediates of vitamin B12 biosynthesis), trimethylpyrrocorphin I (intermediate of factor S3 biosynthesis), and factor S3 derived from various 13C-enriched isotopomers of porphobilinogens were elucidated by 13C NMR. Successive addition of the electron donating methyl groups resulted in the changes in the conjugated array of C=C and C=N bonds of the main macrocycle, which were revealed in the NMR spectra. The differences between precorrin-2 and -3 or factor II and III in their 13C NMR spectra were attributed to the electron distribution of the macrocycle and the disruption of symmetry by C-20 methylation of precorrin-2.

Using a bovine-rodent hybrid somatic cell panel, the previous syntenic assignments for IFNA (U18), EFNB (U18) and IFNG (U3) were verified, and IFNO and IFNT were assigned to bovine syntenic group U18. Syntenic group U18 was subsequently assigned to bovine chromosome 8 by the fluorescent in situ localization of IFNO and IFNT genes to chromosome 8, band 13. With pulsed field gel electrophoresis, physical linkage among IFNA, IFNB, IFNO and IFNT genes was demonstrated. Bovine and ovine IFN restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were identified in Southern blots of genomic DNA using 35 (bovine) and 27 (ovine) probe-enzyme combinations. Following extended electrophoresis, the segregation of bovine RFLPs in 12 probe-enzyme combinations was followed through cattle pedigrees. Codominant segregation of alleles was found for 20 polymorphic IFN loci (5 IFNA, 4 IFNB, 8 IFNO. 2 IFNT and 1 IFNG). A total of 43 IFN genes (10 IFNA, 6 IFNB, 20 IFNO, 6 IFNT and 1 IFNG) were identified in Southern blots of bovine genomic DNA. A provisional genetic map for 8 polymorphic loci was constructed from the analysis of meiotic recombination frequencies in backcross cattle pedigrees. Genetic linkage was not demonstrated between brucellosis resistance and 20 IFN loci in cattle pedigrees segregating resistance to B. abortus as an autosomal dominant trait. However, statistical associations were observed between the presence of specific alleles at 1 IFNB and 2 IFNO loci and the severity of clinical disease following experimental infection with Bovine Herpesvirus-1. A better understanding of the genetic and physical organization of IFN genes in cattle may facilitate the genetic improvement of cattle through selective breeding.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747653931&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs736ce117-2d91-3be5-888a-a68c5c241287i65e4c637-c977-3b2c-9f6c-316787a797bd02791ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002500209245009100234264001000325300004500335336002600380337002800406338002700434504004100461500001000502502004100512500003000553520100400583650001901587655002701606700004101633700005001674700004601724700004701770710005801817856016901875856007802044856015602122994001202278999007902290in0000128310620200904152657.0960328s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34482540  9AGX5960AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34482540  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaD8581 aDuffy, Stephen Mark.10a"No Question of Fighting" :bthe Government, the Army and the Curragh incident, 1914 / 1c1993.  aiv, 295 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

In an effort to forestall the creation of a provisional government in the province of Ulster, the Liberal government instituted a number of troop movements with the intention of ensuring the maintenance of law and order in Northern Ireland. A number of British Army officers stationed at the Curragh military base believed these maneuvers signaled the start of hostile action again Ulster "loyalists" and threatened to accept dismissal rather than comply with the orders. Due to the potential for widespread disaffection throughout the British Army members of the Army Council, unbeknownst to the Prime Minister, granted the officers a "guarantee" that they would not have to act against the Ulstermen. The subsequent uproar in Parliament endangered the stability of Asquith's government, while the unreliability of the Army jeopardized the prospect of a peaceful transition to Irish autonomy. 4aMajor history. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAdams, R.

A survey was designed to evaluate breeder perception, identify management strategies, and define emphasis areas of each breed association consolidated in the American Breeds Coalition. Approximately 2,000 questionnaires were mailed to randomly selected Brahman, Beefmaster, Brangus, and Santa Gertrudis breeders throughout the United States. Field data were obtained from steers consigned to the 1991 and 1992 Texas A&M Ranch to Rail Program to ascertain the postweaning growth traits and carcass attributes of steers representing the surveyed breed groups as compared to their Bos taurus (British and Continental European) contemporaries. Steers consigned in 1991 were fed at Randall County Feedyard (n=467) in Amarillo, Texas, while the 1992 steers were fed either at Randall County Feedyard (n=663) or King Ranch Feedyard (n=517) in Kingsville, Texas. The evaluated breeders were attuned to the strengths and weaknesses of their breeds and repeatedly indicated that the maternal and adaptability characteristics of their cattle, coupled with their crossbreeding abilities, were the basic strengths of their breed and requested for their associations to promote the maternal ability of their breed to the commercial industry. The breeders were not only focusing on traits at the cow/calf phase but contend that the carcass characteristics of their cattle were negative attributes and require modification to maintain breed competitiveness within the next 10 yr. Evaluation of the field data demonstrated no discrepancy in carcass value due to breed characteristics. The Braham-influenced steers had acceptable carcass weights and desirable yield grades coupled with adequate quality grades. The net return from Bos indicus calves were compatible to the Bos taurus type calves, even though, the evaluated feedlot performance traites displayed a vast amount of variation from the Bos indicus calves. Calves with at least 50% of Brahman-or Santa Gertrudis-inheritance had the lowest feeder values. Yet, of the Bos indicus calves, the Santa Gertrudis had the fastest rate of gain while the > 50% Brahman calves were the slowest gaining, least efficient, had the lightest slaughter weights, and were the most variable. 4aMajor animal science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aTurner, J.W.,edegree supervisor.1 aHerd, D.B.,edegree committee member.1 aLarke, Jr., Alvin,edegree committee member.1 aMies, W.L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326461&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554794zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326461&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffsfd2467e5-3294-365d-99ae-ad23c277132ai687223e3-115f-30ae-b50b-c158a4cd37d003825ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099002900201100003500230245008500265264001000350300004600360336002600406337002800432338002700460500002800487502004100515500001000556504004100566500005400607520191500661650002902576650002802605650002602633650004302659655002702702700004102729700004602770700004802816700004902864700004702913710005802960856007803018856015603096994001203252999007903264in0000111031720200904152606.0921223s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27164763  9AFU9941AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)27164763  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaV3681 aVaughan, Ramah Kathryn,d1948-10aCompetitive interference for habitat space among three species of Texas geckos / 1c1991.  axii, 149 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Cyrtopodion scabrum, and Coleonyx brevis, was studied in an indoor laboratory and an outdoor enclosure complex to assess the behavioral I interactions that may affect use of habitat space. H. turcicus and Cyrtopodion scabrum, both of which are introduced, occur syntopically in Galveston, and may be interacting aggressively. The third species is a native Texas gecko, whose continued success might be jeopardized should the ranges of the two introduced species extend westward. For the two introduced species, frequencies of interspecific interactions were greater than in I intraspecific trials. Hemidactylus turcicus was more active in patrolling and tongue flicks than Cyrtopodion scabrum, although frequencies of aggressive behaviors did not differ, Coleonyx brevis did not interact aggressively with either of the introduced geckos, or with conspecifics. Outdoor enclosure trials were conducted to assess the perch choice of each species with and without the presence of the other species. Perch substrate choices varied among the three species of geckos while segregated by species. Hemidactylus turcicus preferred vertical walls, Cyrtopodion scabrum preferred rocks, and Coleonyx brevis preferred ground perches. The distribution of perch choices for visible H. turcicus and Cyrtopodion scabrum remained the same in mixed species trials, however, the proportion of individuals not visible increased for each species. The distribution of perch choices for Coleonyx brevis was not changed by the presence of the other two species. Perch heights varied among the species while segregated and decreased significantly in mixed trials. Directional exposure preference differed between the two introduced species when segregated, but not when mixed. Mean minimum distance moved in a 24-hour interval did not vary among species... 0aGeckosxBehaviorzTexas. 0aGeckosxHabitatzTexas. 0aCompetition (Biology) 4aMajor wildlife and fisheries sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDixon, James R.,edegree supervisor.1 aJudd, Frank W.,edegree committee member.1 aPackard, Jane M.,edegree committee member.1 aSlack, R.

The study evaluated the growth and production responses of kleingrass under early-season grazing to develop improved grazing management strategies. Specific objectives included: a) Identifying phenological development and rate of spring growth of kleingrass; b) Quantifying the growth characteristics of kleingrass measured at the tiller and sward levels; c) Testing quantitative hypothesis addressing growth and senescence of kleingrass under different early-season grazing treatments at the tiller and sward level; and d) Monitoring animal gains and intake, and relating them to plant growth response. The carrying capacity of kleingrass pastures increased by utilizing annual grasses as an alternative to herbicides for the control of these species. The 14-day delay, medium intensity grazing allowed a good harvest of annual grasses before they reached maturation, reducing competition from annual grasses. This maximized animal production and produced a low utilization of kleingrass at the beginning of the study when it was growing exponentially and increased utilization when it was growing linearly, reducing senescence losses. Since utilization of both annual grasses and kleingrass was adequate, average daily gains and gains per hectare were also optimized. The 14-day delay low intensity and all 30-day delay treatments resulted in under utilization of annual grasses, increasing competition from annual grasses and selective grazing of kleingrass. The low intensity treatments produced high average daily gains but low gains per hectare. The 30-day delay treatments resulted in low average daily gains and low gains per hectare. The high intensity and the 0-day delay treatments greatly reduced annual grasses, and thus competition, but imposed such severe grazing on kleingrass that standing crop was reduced. The high intensity treatments produced the lowest average daily gains. The medium intensity treatments produced the highest gains per hectare.

The primary objective was to develop a framework which aligns technology, skills and organizational control, and test this framework. A secondary objective was to establish the existence of distinct types of organizational control. A model was developed using the fundamentals of property rights theory, organizational control, and group norms. The model identified three independent variables which affect transaction costs in an employment relationship. These are, task visibility, skill specificity and task uncertainty. The three independent variables predict five dimensions of control. The dimensions of control are: situational control (monitoring), discretion, outcome-based rewards, professional control (enforcement) and inclusion (residual rights). The model also identified two work orientations, cooperation and competition, which are predicted by the independent variables. One production norm was also specified in the model. This norm is predicted by the controls. Occupational socialization was specified as a mediator between the independent variables and work orientations. It was hypothesized that task visibility will be negatively related to situational control, and positively to, outcome-based rewards and cooperation: that skill specificity will be positively related to inclusion, professional control and occupational socialization. Task uncertainty was hypothesized to be negatively related to discretion and outcome-based rewards. Occupational socialization was hypothesized to predict cooperation. The degree of inclusion and professional control were linked to the peak and range of the production norm. Expected interaction effects were also specified. Data was collected from the shipboard crews of two merchant shipping companies. Results show that task visibility is positively related to personal monitoring and outcome-based rewards. Skill specificity is positively related to professional control, occupational socialization, and within-group competition... 0aRight of propertyxEconomic aspectszUnited States. 0aManagerial economicszUnited States. 0aOrganizational behaviorzUnited States. 0aCorporate culture. 4aMajor management. 7aManagerial economics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01007340 7aOrganizational behavior.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01047801 7aRight of propertyxEconomic aspects.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01097867 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aJones, Gareth R.,edegree supervisor.1 aKeck, Sara L.,edegree committee member.1 aWoodman, Richard W.,edegree committee member.1 aZey, Mary,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932875841xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1472406zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747668091&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs202257bd-d158-373b-8313-24234d72a2f8i6b3667ad-09ea-3479-bf15-35f39f363bee03687ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003500218245011000253264001000363300004800373336002600421337002800447338002700475500002800502502004100530500001000571504004100581500003200622520190800654650003402562650001302596650001802609650002102627655002702648700004002675700004302715700004302758700004502801710005802846856007802904856015602982994001203138999007903150in0000117295420200904152627.0940119s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm29648643  9AGE5981AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)29648643  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaL7831 aLiu, Jennifer Lin-Chun,d1965-10aEnzymes in organic synthesis :buses of CMP-sialic acid synthetase, sialic acid aldolase and subtilisin / 1c1992.  axviii, 132 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

A highly expressed CMP-sialic acid synthetase with a decapeptide tag attached at the C-terminal of the enzyme and the wild type enzyme from E. coli were purified and studied for their properties including their kinetic parameters, stability, pH-rate profiles, metal ions effect, and substrate specificities. Sialic acid derivatives with modifications at the C-5 and C-9 positions were synthesized by combined enzymatic and chemical methods. Sialic acid aldolase which catalyzes the aldol condensation of ManNAc and pyruvate has a broad substrate specificity, and is able to accept a variety of derivatives of ManNAc. Several ManNAc derivatives were prepared from subtilisin catalyzed transesterification reactions. The C-6 position of ManNAc was regioselectively acylated with several activated acyl donors. Similar type of reactions were also applied to the other monosaccharides and disaccharides. Regioselective acylation of nucleotides at the C-5' position of the ribonucleosides catalyzed by subtilisin followed by radical deoxygenation at the C-3' position provides a method for the preparation of the 2',3- dideoxy nucleotides which are potential anti-viral reagents for HIV. Several subtilisin mutants were engineered to increase their stabilities. Their stabilities in organic solvent were studied and these enzymes were applied to the synthetic purposes. Polymerization of methionine methyl ester and resolution of unnatural amino acids were carried out with the mutant enzymes and the wild type BPN'. The modified CMP-sialic acid synthetase has been used in the synthesis of several CMP-NeuAc derivatives from modified ManNAc derivatives and CIP. Sialyl N-acetyllactosamine (NeuAca2,6Galb1,4GlcNAc) was synthesized by a multi-enzyme system with in situ generation of NeuAc and regeneration of CTP and CMP-NeuAc. 0aOrganic compoundsxSynthesis. 0aEnzymes. 0aSialic acids. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWong, Chi-Huey,edegree supervisor.1 aRaushel, Frank M.,edegree supervisor.1 aPace, C.

One key obstacle which has been identified in achieving parallel processing is to communicate effectively between processors during execution. The current research has focused on developing communication methods for parallel processors, which minimize the communication delay. For an N processors machine the optimal delay time is O(log N).  One approach to achieving an optimal delay time is to use expander graph. The networks and algorithms which are based on expander graphs are successfully exploited to yield fast parallel algorithms and efficient design. An important result in this research has been the introduction of the AKS sorting algorithm in time O(log N). This algorithm is based on the use of expanders. The expander graph also can be applied to construct a concentrator and a superconcentrator.  Since Margulis found a way to construct an explicit linear expander graph, several expander graphs have been developed. But the proof of existence of such graphs is in fact provided by a nonconstructive argument.  We investigate the expansion properties of the hypercube network. This is important because the hypercube network is one of the most versatile and efficient networks for parallel computation and is a very popular network in the commercial market. We prove the expansion of a single stage hypercube network and extend this from a single stage to multistage networks. From the analysis of the multistage expansion it takes O(log N) steps to get a constant expansion. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aBouglass, Barry G.,edegree supervisor.1 aGriswold, N.

Accordingly, it is important to impose an appropriate rice policy. Previous research indicates that rice policy has had different major objectives at different time periods. The original objective of rice policy was to encourage rice production. But rapid economic growth and increases in per capita income have led to the changes in rice consumption. For example, the income elasticity for rice in Taiwan changed from positive to negative. Rice production in Taiwan has faced surplus, income, and cost problems created by the current policy. In order to avoid these problems, this study developed a flexible rice policy simulation model which links planning variables together with in the rice model. In order to provide the optimal values of the control instruments, optimal control theory will be applied. The model's objective function will maximize the difference between farmers' total net revenue and government cost. The output variables are the farmers' total net revenue and government cost. The state variables are to ta l expense of government purchased rice, cost of storage, and ending stocks. Three control variables include a government guaranteed purchase price (the support price), quantity purchased per hectare, and the government planning cultivated area. The period of simulation is three years. In addition, econometric dynamic models are used as a constraint function. The penalty function of ending stocks is included in the optimization procedure. 0aRicexGovernment policyzTaiwan. 0aAgriculturexEconomic aspectszTaiwan. 4aMajor agricultural economics. 7aAgriculturexEconomic aspects.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00801415 7aRicexGovernment policy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01097375 7aTaiwan.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01207854 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKnutson, Ronald D.,edegree supervisor.1 aCapps, Oral,edegree committee member.1 aGilbert, Roy F.,edegree committee member.1 aRichardson, James W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1274313zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744871521&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsa3e23686-cd6d-38eb-ada8-5416b2675eb9i6c95d9e0-4a67-380b-a11f-aecfac89053006865ctm a22003495a 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002000072035001400092037001800106040002200124049001500146099002800161100003300189245016800222264008100390300004600471336002600517337002800543338002700571504004100598500001000639502004000649500003200689530006200721500005700783520543300840650002106273856013306294999000906427999007906436in0000130524820190325093133.0960628s1995    xx a     b    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)35004383  9AHB1320AM  a95-34329bUMI  aTXAcTXAdUtOrBLW  aTXAMaTXAR  a1995aDissertationaD671 aDorchak, Joseph John,d1969-10aAspects of the radial chemistry of the thiocarbonyl function and a new synthesis of olefins via Alpha-nitro-Beta-trithiothionocarbonates /cby Joseph John Dorchak. 1a[Place of publication not identified] :b[publisher not identified] ;c1995.  axv, 185 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Spectroscopic studies indicate these peptides are able to adopt a #-sheet structure in aqueous solution.  Residue I nucleates #-sheet structure in aqueous solution through the formation of an intramolecularly hydrogen bonded hydrophobic cluster resulting from interactions between the dibenzofuran skeleton in residue I and the hydrophobic side chains of the a-amino acids flanking residue 1. The hydrophobic cluster acts as a nucleation site which is poised to facilitate    [ ]sheet folding once the charge density in the polycationic tridecapeptide sequence is lowered by adjusting the solution pH or increasing the ionic strength of the solution. Analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation studies reveal that the intramolecularly folded,6-sheet tridecapeptides undergo further self-assembly mediated by intermolecular lateral hydrogen bonding of the pepfide backbone.  This association ultimately yields a quaternary [ ]sheet structure which can be visualized by from electron microscopy studies. The incorporation of N-methylated amino acids into the peptide sequence serves to block the lateral hydrogen bonding network and has shown promise towards preventing p-sheet association.  The potential for the formation of the cisisomer about the N-methyl amide, however, can produce unwanted peptide backbone conformations.  Circular dichroism, NMR and analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation studies reveal that the N-methylated peptides are monomeric and adopt p-sheet structure, although not as well-defined as the associated #-sheets.  The [ ]sheet structure present in these N-methylated peptides can be further stabilized by increasing the temperature or by addition of trifluoroethanol. Relative and absolute reaction rates were determined in a systematic study of reagents and derivatives for the Barton-McCombie deoxygenation reaction.  Derivatives (S-methyldithiothionocarbonate, phenylthionocarbonate, 4-chlorophenylthionocarbonate, 4-fluorophenylthionocarbonate, 2,4,6-trichlorophenylthionocarbonate, 2,3,4,5,6 pentafluorophenylthionocarbonate, S-(2,4-ditnitrophenyl) dithiothionocarbonate, and N,N-(diethyl)-thionocarbamate) of model alcohols (cyclododecanol and cholesterol) were synthesized and reacted under standard conditions (100 'C or I 10 'C, AEBN initiator) with tributyltin hydride.  Rate data were obtained by quantitative IH-NMR. In nearly every case, Barton-McCombie deoxygenation was much faster than expected -literature methods generally advised reaction times of three hours or more.  Furthermore, there was little appreciable difference in reaction rates for most of the derivatives (first half-lives were about 0.5 - 1.0 min).  The xanthate (S-methyldithiothionocarbonate) reacted somewhat faster than any of the arylthionocarbonate derivatives - among these, a decreased reaction rate was noted for derivatives with greater electronegative substitution on the phenyl ring. Exceptions were noted in reactions of the S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) dithiothionocarbonate and NN-(diethyl)-thionocarbamate derivatives.  The NN-(diethyl)-thionocarbamate derivative remained essentially unchanged even after prolonged reaction times, while the S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) dithiothionocarbonate derivative reacted to give 2,4-dinitrobenzene and the starting alcohol instead of the expected deoxygenation product. Reaction rates were also obtained for the synthesis of several arylthionoformate derivatives of cholesterol (model alcohol).  The model alcohol was treated with pyridine and an arylchlorothionoformates (phenyl chlorothionoformate, 4-chlorophenyl chlorothionoformate, 4-fluorophenyl chlorothionoformate, 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl chlorothionoformate, and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl chlorothionoformate).  Rates for the acylation were measured under standard conditions (25 'C, CDC13 soln) using quantitative I H-NMR.  Acylation using 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl chlorothionoformate was much slower than with any of the other reagents (first half-life = 27 min).  Rates for the remaining reagents tended to increase with greater electronegative substitution on the phenyl ring.  First half-lives for these ranged from 0.5 - 3.5 min, with 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl chlorothionoformate reacting more than twice as fast as any of the other reagents. A new method for the synthesis of olefins from nitroolefins or (X-nitro alcohols was developed.  The reactions involved are quite mild. and the use of undesirable tributyltin hydride is avoided.  A pivotal step is nucleophilic Michael addition of S-ethyl trithiothionocarbonate to non-hindered vinylic nitroolefins.  The novel (x-nitro trithiothionocarbonate derivatives can generally be obtained in near quantitative yield without purification.  Radical-induced (visible light photolysis of 1-2 eq of N-(2-methylpropionyloxy)-pyridine-2-thione as radical source) elimination of the ethyltrithiothionocarbonate and nitro moieties gave olefins (mixture of E and Z) in good to high yields.  Olefins were prepared using several simple model compounds.  This method was also applied in the synthesis of 7,8-dideoxy-1,2:3,4-di-0-isopropylidene-(X-D-galacto-oct-6-ene-1,5pyranose. 4aMajor chemistry.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=742145091&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aMARSffsa14937da-83e9-33f6-80f1-56e40066081ei6cfcae58-00aa-3a8e-97e6-3183b0fb0a2e03939ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099003000189100001800219245016800237264001000405300004600415336002600461337002800487338002700515504004100542500001000583502004100593500003000634520199200664650002502656650003602681650002502717650003402742650001202776650001902788655002702807700004002834700005202874700005002926700004602976700005203022710005803074856007803132856015603210994001203366999007903378in0000118962320200904152620.0940906s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31056215  9AGH7604AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)31056215  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaH43171 aHe, Shiliang.14aThe carbonic acid system and solubility of calcium carbonate and sulfate in aqueous solutions over a wide range of solution composition, temperature and pressure / 1c1992.  axiv, 279 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The experimental results are in good agreement with previous measurements in dilute solutions available in the literature. Stoichiometric activity coefficients for CO2(aq), HCO3-, and CO3[^2-] were calculated from these experimental data. Pitzer parameters for interactions between the carbonic acid species and major ions Na[^+], K[^+], Ca[^2+], Mg[^2+], Cl[^-], and SO4[^2-] were obtained by regression analysis. Experimental data at 25°C and 1 atm were used to evaluate Pitzer parameters in the literature. The Pitzer model, in association with the ion-pairing model and Pitzer parameter data sets from both Harvie's group and Pitzer's group, provides proper estimates of activity coefficients within the range of experimental uncertainty. The new Pitzer parameters for the carbonic acid system were consistent with parameters for other systems from either Harvie's group or Pitzer's group. A chemical model based on thermodynamic constants, and osmotic and activity coefficients estimated from Pitzer equations were found to predict accurately calcite solubility in the literature. Calcite solubility in synthetic brines (Na-K-Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4) was measured from 0 to 90°C in open systems from both undersaturation and supersaturation. It was found that calcite solubilities predicted using Pitzer model were generally in good agreement with experimental solubility data obtained from undersaturation. However, this was not the case when equilibrium was approached from supersaturation. The discrepancy between experimental data and predicted data may result from the fact that adsorbed and/or coprecipitated ions (such as Mg2+ and SO$[^2-]) on calcite surfaces tend to maintain a metastable equilibrium between the surface and bulk solution... 0aSolution (Chemistry) 0aCarbonate mineralsxSolubility. 0aCalcitexSolubility. 0aSulfate mineralsxSolubility. 0aGypsum. 4aMajor geology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMorse, John W.,edegree supervisor.1 aDomenico, Patrick A.,edegree committee member.1 aGrossman, Ethan L.,edegree committee member.1 aHajash, Andrew,edegree committee member.1 aLoeppert, Richard H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1394912zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746516881&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs25d58698-d9ec-387b-84e1-5865f792cbf4i6e3a810a-0d5c-35a3-9483-b80e7437af2a03041ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004400109035002000153049000900173099002900182100002500211245010000236264001000336300004700346336002600393337002800419338002700447500002800474502004100502500001000543504004100553500004500594520122200639650002801861650004701889650002901936650003401965655002701999700004702026700004902073700005302122700005402175710005802229856007802287856012702365994001202492999007902504in0000111233820200904152539.0921016s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm26796035  9AFU7025AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)26796035  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaA2191 aAdams, William John.10aCMOS operational transconductance amplifiers with extended transconductance adjustment ranges / 1c1991.  axvii, 232 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

In transconductor-based electronic systems, the transconductance adjustment is useful in overcoming integrated circuit process variations and in implementing systems with program m able specifications. Linearity of the transfer characteristic is also highly desirable; however the adjustment of previously-reported transconductors via adjustment of a tail current in a differential-pair-based input stage typically involves severe linearity degradation. The techniques presented in this work are based on the use of program m able current mirrors as a means of transconductance adjustment; furthermore, current mirrors are presented which actually perform the desired linearization of the currents generated by a simple differential pair input stage. This leads to fairly simply transconductor circuits which largely avoid the adjustment/linearity tradeoffs inherent in many previous designs. Experimental results verify the extended adjustment/linearization schemes. A detailed analysis of mismatch effects is included which suggests methods by which these undesirable effects may be reduced. 0aOperational amplifiers. 0aMetal oxide semiconductors, Complementary. 0aElectronic conductivity. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aRamirez-Mngulo, Jaime,edegree supervisor.1 aEverett, Louis J.,edegree committee member.1 aPandey, Rahhvendra K.,edegree committee member.1 aSanchez-Sinecio, Edgar,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1274326zLink to OAKTrust copy40uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303956165?accountid=7082zLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs7f399851-2276-3db5-96e4-da6e614dac87i6e586b75-be80-36c3-aab8-7862ad9af60d04557ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006800109035002000177043001200197049000900209099002900218100003700247245009400284264001000378300002600388336002600414337002800440338002700468500002800495502004100523500001000564504004100574500005200615520232700667650002802994650003303022650003903055650004703094650005203141651003703193650004103230655002703271700004303298700004803341700004903389700004903438710005803487856016903545856007803714856015603792994001203948999007903960in0000099573020200904152537.0901212s1990    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22842352  9AEX8949AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLdUMIdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)22842352  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaW5821 aWhite, Bettie Sue Florey,d1929-10aCognitive functioning of deaf young adults as determined by Wechsler Performance Scales / 1c1990.  ax, 89 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

It also compared performance results of the deaf young adults with performance of adults in general as reflected by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) standardization norms. Subjects for the study were from Dallas and Houston Regional Day School Programs for the Deaf and from Texas School for the Deaf, located in Austin. One hundred eighty protocols revealed Performance IQ and five subtest scaled scores for each subject; these constituted the six dependent variables. Analysis of Variance was used to investigate main effects for type of schooling and degree of loss on the dependent variables and possible interaction effects between the two factors (schooling and hearing loss). A one-sample t-test compared the Performance IQ (PIQ) mean and the subtest scaled score means of the study's sample to the WAIS-R PIQ mean of 100 and the subtest scaled score mean of 10 at the.05 and.01 levels of significance. Measures of central tendency and variability were used to examine patterns of performance. Results revealed no significant differences between test means on performance of deaf young adults for degree of hearing loss. Type of schooling yielded significant differences on the PA and BD subtests; however, less confidence can be placed on the PA subtest because of unequal variances. The study's sample scored statistically different from the means of the national normed group. There is a distinct pattern of performance as found in samples of deaf children. The group did not produce scores which "fall toward the mean" as suggested by the developmental theory that scores improve with age for deaf individuals. The unexpected finding that this sample of deaf young adults in Texas scored about one standard deviation below the norm negates the claim of Vernon and others that deaf individuals score within the normal range when non-verbal measures are used. Possible explanations for the discrepancy are presented as relating to such factors as the selection of tests, the individuals' approach to test-taking, skill of examiners, use of interpreters. Recommendations for further study with more controlled conditions are outlined. 0aDeafxEducationzTexas. 0aVocational educationzTexas. 0aWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. 7aDeafxEducation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00888447 7aVocational education.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01168486 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 4aMajor adult and extension education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStone, Barbara N.,edegree supervisor.1 aKapes, Jerome T.,edegree committee member.1 aParrish, Linda H.,edegree committee member.1 aShutes, Robert E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:902728941xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1109019zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747120041&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs0a0452a2-ad3f-3d4d-85ae-7e586ca281dai6f2f5696-51f5-3ec9-a66d-c0b546adb59903107ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004400109035002000153049000900173099002900182100003100211245012600242264001000368300004600378336002600424337002800450338002700478500002800505502004100533500001000574504004100584500003200625520123500657650002501892650003101917650003901948650002101987655003702008655002702045700004402072700004602116700004602162700004602208710005802254856007802312856015602390994001202546999007902558in0000099822320200904152506.0910110s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22942825  9AEY7870AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)22942825  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaG4481 aGibson, Guy Randal,d1962-10aIntrazeolite ruthenium carbonyls :bapplications to the conversion of CO₂ to methane and to other catalytic processes / 1c1990.  axii, 112 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Characterization by IR and size-selective phosphine reactions indicates that the trimer carbonyl was successfully placed inside the zeolite structure. Evaluation of this new material as a catalyst for CO2 methanation revealed that no advantage is gained by placing Ru3(CO)12 inside the structure over using a Ru3(CO)12/NaY catalyst in which the metal cluster is known to reside on the outer surface of the zeolite support. Indeed, there are indications that the metal in the activated catalyst which begins in the interior of the zeolite prefers to come to the surface when reactant H2 is depleted. This migration to the outside of the support is accompanied by a rise in catalytic activity. The encapsulated Ru3(CO)12/NaY complex was also evaluated as a pseudo-homogeneous catalyst for the water-gas shift reaction and the carbonylation of methanol to methyl formate . While some of the reaction chemistry of the complex mimicked well-established solution chemistry, the complex offered no significant advantage over homogeneous catalysts. 0aRuthenium catalysts. 0aOrganorutheniumxResearch. 0aRutheniumxSynthesisvRegulations. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aRules.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423857 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDarensbourg, D.

These jets are frequently used in industry, however their flow field dynamics are not understood. The objective of this study was to increase the understanding of the rectangular jet. To do this, two rectangular nozzles were constructed and the subsonic jet velocities were measured, analyzed, and interpreted. The study concentrated on the near field region where the three dimensional flow field develops. Nozzles with aspect ratios of 1x2 and 1x4 were used to create jets at a Match number of 0.09. Measurements were made using a 3 component laser Doppler anemometry system. A dense measurement grid was used to effectively map the jets in both axial and cross sectional planes. The analysis included the time averaged velocity field, the complete Reynolds stress tensor, vorticity, turbulent kinetic energy production and other parameters. Comparisons were made with previous studies. Also a method of determining the mean pressure change in the jet flow field based on velocity and Reynolds stress tensor gradients was presented and compared with experimental data and numerical predictions. The results, analysis and interpretation were frequently related to previous theoretical vortex system models. As a result of discrepancies, a new vortex system model is presented. This study contributes substantially to the current understanding of 3 dimensional jet flow fields. 0aJetsxFluid dynamics. 0aTurbulence. 0aReynolds stress. 4aMajor mechanical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMorrison, G.

AMOS (Automated Multiple-Response Optimum-Seeker for Simulations) is an integrated system of Prolog and Fortran programs, implemented on a microcomputer, which seeks to automatically optimize a weighted linear combination of response variables produced by a constrained number of simulation runs. The available simulation runs are allocated to "stages" of the experiment. Within each stage, a modified Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is used to maximize a "created" objective function over a bounded search region. The size of the search region is reduced from stage to stage, until available simulation runs are exhausted, or desired convergence is achieved. AMOS automatically performs all the steps of the modified RSM. It generates the experimental designs and executes the simulations to produce the response variable observations. Each response variable is modeled and tested for "fit" using Least Squares Regression and Analysis of Variance. Failure of any one response model to "fit" causes AMOS to design and execute the next higher resolution experiment, up to a central composite design. The fitted models are "weighted" and summed to form the created objective function. The weights are normalized values derived from user-specified priorities. The created objective function is then maximized, over the current search region, using Golden Section Search or Canonical Analysis, as appropriate to the order of the polynomial model. The "optimal" point in any stage becomes the starting point for the REM in the next stage. AMOS executes on any standard IBM-compatible microcomputer, with at least 640k bytes of memory and the MS-DOS operating system. Three examples illustrate the AMOS approach. 0aAMOS (Computer program) 0aComputer simulation. 0aResponse surfaces (Statistics) 0aMathematical optimization. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPhillips, Don T.,edegree supervisor.1 aHocking, Ronald R.,edegree committee member.1 aHogg, Gary L.,edegree committee member.1 aShannon, Robert E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:902724541xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1117210zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747346341&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs8dcdb6fe-2f94-3bfd-a281-a311aefe7bb6i70c9fe81-5253-3b3e-8929-fb19f6932d5103647ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100004100223245006800264264001000332300004700342336002600389337002800415338002700443504004100470500001000511502004100521500003900562650002100601650003100622650001900653650002000672650002800692655002700720700004200747700004200789700004800831700004900879710005800928856007800986520187801064856015602942994001203098999007903110in0000123378220200904152706.0950712s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32805223  9AGT4187AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32805223  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG6431 aGonzalez Rodriguez, Humberto,d1959-10aPhysiological responses of Zea mays (L.) roots to NaCl stress / 1c1993.  axvii, 131 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Experiments were conducted on etiolated seedlings grown in a standard nutrient solution to which NaCI was added. At concentrations of 100 mM NaCI, the sa stress did not inhibit root elongation, whereas the ss stress initially inhibited root growth. However, after 12 h, root elongation of salinized roots attained a rate of 2 mm/h, similar to control roots. Seedlings treated with 1 μM fluridone to block synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) resulted in reduced root elongation in control and NaCI-treated roots. Exogenous ABA at concentrations above 2.0 μM inhibited root elongation. The inhibitory effects of ABA on root growth were stronger than those effects due to 100 mM NaCI. Despite the gradual and sharp declines in root osmotic potential (ψπ) and water potential (ψw) in the 0 to 3 and 3 to 10 mm root zone, root turgor potential (ψp) remained constant in both salt stress protocols. The early- and long-term changes in ψπ in the 0 to 3 mm zone were associated mainly with the accumulation of Na+, K+, Cl-, and sucrose. Their contribution to ψπ (bar) was about -2.1, -4.2, -3.6, and -1.0 bar, respectively. In contrast, in the 3 to 10 mm zone, the contribution to ψπ (bar) was -2.2 (Cl-), -2.0 (Na+), -2.8 (K+), and -1.0 (glucose and fructose). The total contribution of inorganic and organic osmolytes to ψπ ranged between 70 to 90% of the estimated root ψπ. It appears that sucrose and proline are mainly compartmented within the cytoplasm (0 to 3 mm zone), whereas glucose and fructose appear to be compartmented primarily in the vacuole (3 to 10 mm zone).41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744945871&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd1f0d00c-e997-323e-8896-a3ddab6d74bei70dc1ff9-3d3b-3f64-8972-2c3754ca4f6804471ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165043001200185050001700197049000900214099002900223100002800252245007100280264001000351300002900361336002600390337002800416338002700444500002800471502004100499500001000540504004100550500004300591520226800634650004402902650004602946650005702992650005503049651004503104650003203149655002703181700004203208700004903250700004803299700005403347710005803401856016903459856007803628856015603706994001203862999007903874in0000099004920200904152510.0910314s1990    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23244899  9AEY9178AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23244899  an-us--- 4aHV9288b.H86  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaH9171 aHulsey, Lonnie Freeman.10aAttitudes of employers with respect to hiring released prisoners / 1c1990.  axii, 117 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The survey research method was used for this study. The instrument used to collect the data was an item response form. The sample consisted of private sector employers in East Texas. The 229 employers who returned usable survey forms constituted the study sample on which the data were analyzed and reported. Findings: 1. The majority of the respondents were not willing to hire released prisoners. 2. Of the selected reasons respondents were willing to hire released prisoners, "crime does not relate to job" ranked the highest, while "legal obligation" ranked the lowest. 3. Of the selected reasons respondents were not willing to hire released prisoners, "lack of honesty and trustworthiness" ranked the highest, while "employment would adversely affect community" ranked the lowest. 4. Of the selected crimes relating to respondents' willingness to hire released prisoners, drug abuse/DWI ranked the highest, while crimes against children ranked the lowest. 5. Respondents were more willing to hire released prisoners for semi-skilled and skilled jobs, as well as for short-term or temporary jobs, than for any of the other given jobs. Conversely, respondents were less willing to hire released prisoners for professional jobs or for upwardly-mobile jobs than for any of the other given jobs. 6. The respondent characteristics of (a) type of firm, (b) age of firm, (c) size of firm, and (d) hiring policy of firm were not significantly related to the willingness of respondents to hire released prisoners. 7. The respondent characteristic of union status of firm was significantly related statistically to the willingness of respondents to hire released prisoners. 8. Respondents frequently followed a contingency, or situational, approach with respect to hiring released prisoners. 0aEx-convictsxEmploymentzUnited States. 0aEmployer attitude surveyszUnited States. 7aEmployer attitude surveys.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00909276 7aEx-convictsxEmployment.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00917425 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 4aMajor industrial education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGutcher, G.

Benzene is the most toxic and most mobile hydrocarbon constituent among these chemical. Benzene level in the contaminated soil from a spill can be used as a determining factor in selecting response actions for cleaning up the contaminated area regarding the protection of groundwater resources. This study developed cleanup criteria for oil and petroleum contaminated soils at spill sites. The maximum contaminant level (MCL) of benzene allowable in drinking water as established by USEPA was selected as a criterion to assess whether or not the groundwater will be contaminated as the result of the entering of benzene contained soil leachate at the spill site. If the anticipated maximum benzene concentration in soil leachate reaching the groundwater table is below the MCL, no action is needed to protect the groundwater and the natural degradation processes will take care of the spilled materials. If the anticipated maximum benzene concentration in soil leachate is close to the MCL when it reaches the groundwater level or there is no usable groundwater aquifers in the spill area, minor treatment actions can be taken to treat the contaminated soil on site; such as in situ bioremediation, in situ air-venting, surface covering, or addition of natural organic materials to the contaminated soil. If the anticipated maximum benzene concentration in soil leachate entering the groundwater will be much greater than the MCL and the groundwater resource is likely to be contaminated, major remedial actions will be needed. Should the remedial actions mentioned above be proven to be insufficient, contaminated soils will need to be removed from the spill site for off-site treatment at a commercialized treatment facility or disposal at a regulated hazardous waste disposal site.

Results support the hypothesis that deer are adapted to eating browse because of their ability to easily digest cell solubles and rapidly remove indigestible particulate matter. Results do not support the hypothesis that deer maximize phosphorus (P) digestibility at the expense of other nutrients to meet their P requirements. Dry matter intake(DMI) varied seasonally and was related positively to compartment turnover rate and negatively to the amount of cell wall in the diet. Mean in vivo dry matter digestibility (DMD) for the pelleted diet was 75.6%. Because of small condensed tannin (7.83 mg/g), lignin (2.62%) and neutral detergent fiber bound nitrogen (NDFN) levels (7 .88%), protein and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibilities in the pellet diet were high, 73.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Seasonal DMD for guajillo varied from 48.1% in the early spring to 35.2% in late summer. Blackbrush and brazil mean DMD were 36.3% and 49.1% respectively. Digestibility of the crude protein (CP) in guajillo varied from 45.8% in early spring to 13.7% in late summer. Low DMD and CP digestibilities were related to high condensed tannin (89.9 to 117.9 mg/g), and NDFN (46.2% to 54.0%) levels. Digestible energy (DE) was highly correlated with DMD (R2 = 0.99) for all diets. Mineral digestibilities were low for each diet except P which had strongly negative digestibilities. Turnover rates were slowest (17 to 21%/hr) in those diets which were more highly digested. Total tract mean retention time (MRT) was fastest in the late summer guajillo diet (37.1 hours) which was the least digested diet. The standard 2-stage in vitro technique accurately predicted in vivo dry matter, energy, and protein digestibilities with confidence, R2 = 0.89, 0.92, 0.93, respectively. 0aWhite-tailed deerxMetabolism. 0aWhite-tailed deerxFeeding and feeds. 4aMajor wildlife and fisheries sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBlakenship, Lytle H.,edegree supervisor.1 aGrant, William E.,edegree committee member.1 aHamilton, Wayne,edegree committee member.1 aVarner, Larry W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:890476141xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-791396zLink to OAKTrust copy40uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303754993?accountid=7082zLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs266adafe-1a6c-36ec-b24b-99bcc48bb587i73451b7c-53aa-3f86-b319-7d16d32f735d03814ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100004100197245010300238264001000341300004300351336002600394337002800420338002700448504004100475500001000516502004100526500003000567520212600597650001902723655002702742700004402769700004702813700004902860700005302909700004702962710005803009856007803067856015603145994001203301999007903313in0000126648320200904152715.0960305s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34312189  9AGX0103AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34312189  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaM2511 aMalicse, Jose Ariel Enriquez,d1960-10aSedimentary processes and facies of a desert fluvial system in southern Death Valley, California / 1c1993.  ax, 90 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The southern section of Death Valley basin is bordered by coalescing alluvial fans and is drained along its axis by the terminal end of the Amargosa River system. The terminal end of the Amargosa river was investigated with the following objectives: 1) to document the facies of an ephemeral stream in a hydrologically closed, pull-apart basin, and 2) to characterize its sand body geometries. The ephemeral fluvial system in southern Death Valley, California exhibits a succession of channel patterns and facies that can be divided into proximal, middle, and distal regions. The proximal region is narrow with steep gradient (3 to 5m/km), and is dissected by a single, straight braided channel with narrow, down-dip widening floodplain. The facies sequence in the proximal region is dominated by tabular lenses of crudely bedded gravel overlain by trough to planar cross-bedded coarse sand, and planar to ripple laminated fine sand. The proximal region grades down-dip into the low-gradient (0.5 to 1.7 m/km) anastomosing streams of the middle region. These anastomosing streams are characterized by interconnected networks of shallow, straight and meandering channels in a vast muddy floodplain. The straight channels have high width to depth ratio and are generally sandy; in contrast, the meandering channels have low width to depth ratio and are generally muddy. The migration of the anastomosing channels within the muddy floodplains produces isolated, thin (less than 1 m) sand bodies that are encased in a muddy facies. Their facies consist of massive to cross-bedded sand, ripple-laminated muddy sand, and wavy to planar laminated mud. The anastomosing system shows an overall decrease in its sand to mud ratio, and grades downdip into the nearly flat (less than 0.5 m/km) distal region. This distal region is characterized by few, shallow, straight to meandering muddy channels and widespread salt-encrusted to desiccated mudflats. The facies of the distal region consist of muddy facies with gypsum and halite crystals. 4aMajor Geology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMazzullo, James M.,edegree supervisor.1 aBerg, Robert R.,edegree committee member.1 aGiardino, John R.,edegree committee member.1 aTchakerian, Vatche P.,edegree committee member.1 aTieh, Thomas T.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1520235zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745226441&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs331daa67-de14-3230-8f59-dd1feb483cfei7360eabd-ac2d-31f0-88ce-7183beb448a904803ctm a2200529Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165043001200185049000900197099002900206100003200235245009600267264001000363300002800373336002600401337002800427338002700455504004100482500001000523502004100533500004900574520243900623650004603062650004403108650005003152650003803202650005803240650005503298650005703353651004503410655004803455655002703503700004103530700005203571700004603623700005203669710005803721856016903779856007803948856015604026994001204182999007904194in0000121710920200904152705.0950417s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32321100  9AGS1377AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32321100  an-us---  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG3411 aGenzer, Susan Marie,d1967-10aActual and ideal workloads of educational public relations directors in the United States / 1c1993.  axv, 198 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

More specific objectives were to determine if significant differences existed among and between educational public relations directors with regard to gender, years of public relations experience, levels of education, and student enrollment. Developed by the researcher, the study questionnaire was divided into three sections: general background data, 26 task statements, and an open-ended response section. The questionnaire was administered to 150 public school public relations directors who were members of the National School Public Relations Association (NSPRA). Responses (77% return rate) were analyzed using the Statistical Application System (SAS) computer program. Responding directors had similar backgrounds, were well educated, holding advanced degrees, held administrative team membership, possessed a degree in journalism, communications, English, or education, and were predominantly female (76%). For the most part the actual and ideal percentage of time directors spent on completing their tasks were unaffected by their varying educational levels and student enrollments. The most frequently performed (actual) tasks of the responding directors were preparing district-wide newsletters or newspapers, writing news releases, and coordinating communications to various media. While directors, for example, wanted more involvement in developing district-wide community programs, they wanted less involvement with traditional tasks, such as producing photographs and audio/visual materials. Open-ended responses that made task completion easier were having access to their superintendent and having the necessary computer equipment. A lack of staff, too many additional "catch all" duty assignments, insufficient time, and lack of funding were seen as making task completion difficult. Recommendations emanating from the study included focusing master's and doctoral level coursework for public relations directors on tasks identified as important in the study and having a greater rapport between NSPRA and the American Association of School Administrators to provide inservice for school administrators on the role of PR directors, task priorities, needed equipment, and necessary planning time. 0aSchoolsxPublic relationszUnited States. 0aSchoolszUnited StatesxAdministration. 0aPublic relations personnelvJob descriptions. 4aMajor educational administration. 7aPublic relations personnel.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01082935 7aSchoolsxAdministration.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01107962 7aSchoolsxPublic relations.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01108022 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 7aJob descriptions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423834 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWest, Philip T.,edegree supervisor.1 aBratlien, Maynard J.,edegree committee member.1 aFox, Milden J.,edegree committee member.1 aWhetten, Clifford L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932872441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1475134zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747668451&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsffb6a81c-1352-3fae-951e-35956bc13d51i736b0eb1-9768-3bda-8855-e221af52a8a103296ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003200218245012000250264001000370300004500380336002600425337002800451338002700479500002800506502004100534500001000575504004100585500003200626520150200658650002402160650001802184650002002202650002102222655002702243700004402270700004802314700004302362700005002405710005802455856007802513856015602591994001202747999007902759in0000112198920200904152601.0930202s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27358653  9AFV8269AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27358653  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaP8611 aPoteat, Jerry Louis,d1957-10aSynthesis, ligand properties, and interfacial chemistry of metal carboxylate terminated oligomers of polyethylene / 1c1991.  aix, 116 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

These oligomers were used to study ligation of metals by soluble metal carboxylates. They were also used to study chemistry at functionalized polyethylene surfaces. Using europium salts and fluorescence spectroscopy, we were able to show that an oligomeric carboxylic acid was a slightly better ligand for metal salts than octadecanoic acid. These studies quantified the ability of an oligomeric carboxylic acid to recover a metal and showed the potential utility for carboxylated ethylene oligomers as ligands for recoverable catalysts. We also used virgin polyethylene functionalized with copper carboxylate terminated ethylene oligomers to examine several aspects of chemistry at polymer interfaces. Kinetic plots for exchange reactions of diphenylthiocarbazone with copper at the polymer-solvent interface showed two distinct pseudo-first-order regions. The faster exchange involved a small amount of copper and occurred with a rate constant of 14.2 x 10^-5 s^-1. Region 2 involved more of the copper and the exchange rate constant was 1.86 x 10^-5 s^-1. These two regions merged into one when the polymer was annealed at [greater than or equal to] 100 °C. These reactions showed an Arrhenius temperature dependence in toluene and chloroform at -10 - 60 °C. We also observed that >75% of the total copper present in the polymer sample was extracted at 25 °C in toluene versus only 25% in chloroform. 0aPolymersxSurfaces. 0aPolyethylene. 0aMetallic soaps. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBergbreiter, David,edegree supervisor.1 aHall, Michael B.,edegree committee member.1 aHam, Joe S.,edegree committee member.1 aNewcomb, Martin E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1284246zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746228101&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs9695ae66-d29e-365a-a130-0fa1ccaf731di74b30ee2-e263-35ff-a8d9-4551ce6fcb0804120ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172050002100192049000900213099002900222100002900251245011500280264001000395300004600405336002600451337002800477338002700505504004100532500001000573502004100583500004000624520204900664650002702713650003502740650003402775650003502809650002902844655002702873700003902900700004302939700004702982700004803029710005803077776017803135856007803313856015603391994001203547999007903559in0000119853020200904152640.0940928s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31191651  9AGJ0447AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdSTFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)31191651 4aTN880b.T9 1992a  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaT9981 aTzirita, Antiopy,d1949-12aA study of electrical and thermal properties and their use to detect natural gas hydrates in ocean sediments / 1c1992.  axix, 267 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Since recovery of hydrate samples is very difficult using conventional geotechnical sampling operations the development of in situ detection methods becomes essential. In this research the electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of hydrates were studied experimentally using tetrahydrofuran as a hydrate former. An experimental apparatus was designed for this purpose and an automated control system was developed to form cylindrical specimens, freezing them unidirectionally from top to bottom. Massive hydrates and sediment-hydrate mixtures were formed and studied. The electrical resistivity of all hydrate specimens increased drastically upon hydrate formation to values that varied from 2x10^5 to 2x10^4 Ohm-m for frequencies ranging from 100 to 1000 Hz. The presence of brine in the specimens reduced the electrical resistivity and masked the frequency effects. The thermal conductivity was determined for steady state conditions in the cylindrical specimens by solving the three dimensional axisymmetric heat conduction problem and inverting the temperature data. The thermal conductivity of massive hydrate specimens varied from 0.18 to 0.48 Wm^-1K^-1 Sand- and clay-hydrate specimens had a thermal conductivity similar to water saturated specimens, increasing with decreasing porosity. An electrical resistivity probe appears to be a promising method of hydrate detection in ocean sediments where the hydrate layer may be represented by a resistive layer in a conductive earth. Based on the studies conducted the resolution of the resistivity and thickness is very satisfactory. Hydrate formation in sediments was modelled by a moving heat source and the change of sediment temperatures due to hydrate formation was calculated based on the rate of hydrate formation and the thermal properties of the sediments. The results indicate that local changes of the geothermal gradient in conjunction with other measurements may be used to detect hydrates. 0aNatural gasxHydrates. 0aHydratesxElectric properties. 0aHydratesxThermal properties. 0aMarine sedimentsxGas content. 4aMajor civil engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDunlap, W.

Firm size varies from 50,000 to 1,300,000 square feet of greenhouse space with 87% of the space being allocated to finishing the plants. The primary market is to price-oriented chain store accounts within the state of Texas. The primary competition is from Florida growers. The managers of the firms feel that an oversupply of plants in the market place will be a major factor limiting the success of their business over the next five years. The large size firms have an annual total cost per square foot of production space of $2.22. Cost of goods sold accounts for 60% of total cost for the large firms. Labor is the largest single expense with total labor accounting for 39% of total costs for the large firms. An operations process chart was used to identify potting labor and harvest labor as two parts of the production process which hold potential for variability. Potting labor varies between container sizes, plant species and the form of the plant material being potted. Potting labor for the large firms was estimated to be 22% of production labor and 6.6% of total costs. Harvest labor varies between container sizes, plant species, and the type of box used to ship the plants. The cost of harvest labor for the large firms was estimated to be 29.1% of production labor and 7.8% of total costs. The combined cost to pot and harvest the plants as estimated for the large firms was 51.1% of production labor and 14.4% of total costs. The variations between species documented in the potting labor and harvest labor studies are to a substantial degree different from the variation in labor allocation accounted for on the basis of the production space being occupied by a particular plant. Any uniform allocation of production labor costs may introduce substantial error into the estimate of the cost of producing the plant. 0aGreenhouse managementzRio Grande Valley (Colo.-Mexico and Tex.) 0aFoliage plant industryzRio Grande Valley (Colo.-Mexico and Tex.)xCost control. 0aFoliage plantsxMarketing. 4aMajor horticulture. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aReed, David Wm.,edegree supervisor.1 aLitzenberg, Kerry,edegree committee member.1 aShumway, Richard,edegree committee member.1 aTownsend, Christine,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910699741xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1163143zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744838991&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsc036ecfa-9881-3b0a-a834-6cd719d47960i75942072-a050-3484-946a-7bd46fdbacdd04063ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003400218245011200252264001000364300004600374336002600420337002800446338002700474500002800501502004100529500001000570504004100580500003000621520221600651650002602867650002302893650001302916650001902929655002702948700004102975700005203016700004403068700005103112700004703163710005803210856007803268856015603346994001203502999007903514in0000111027120200904152539.0921209s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27089796  9AFU9895AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27089796  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaA2851 aAhluwalia, Dharam Vir,d1952-10aRelativistic quantum field theory of high-spin matter fields :ba pragmatic approach for hadronic physics / 1c1991.  axiv, 227 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Guided by an approach originally proposed by Weinberg, we construct from group theoretical arguments the (j, 0) [circle plus] (0,j) covariant spinors and the field operators for a massive particles. Specific examples are worked out in the familiar language of the Bjorken and Drell text for the case of the (1,0) [circle plus] (0,1), (3/2,0) [circle plus] (0,3/2) and (2,0) [circle plus] (0,2) matter fields. The m [to] 0 limit of the covariant spinors is shown to have the expected structure. The algebra of the [gamma][^uv] matrices associated with the (1, 0) [circle plus] (0, 1) matter fields is presented, and the conserved current derived. The procedure readily extends to higher spins. The causality problem associated with the j [greater than or equal to] 1 wave equations is discussed in detail and a systematic procedure to construct causal propagators is provided. As an example a spin two wave equation satisfied by the (2, 0) [circle plus] (0, 2), covariant spinors is found to support not only ten correct and causal solutions, but also thirty physically unacceptable acausal solutions. However, we demonstrate how to construct the Feynman propagator for the higher spin particles directly from the spinors and thus avoid the shortcomings of the wave equation in building a phenomenology. The same exercise is repeated for the (1,0) [circle plus] (0,1) and (3/2,0) [circle plus] (0,3/2) matter fields, and the same conclusions obtained. A well-known set of linear equations for massless free particles of arbitrary spin is found to have acausal solutions. On the other hand, the m [to] 0 limit of the wave equations satisfied by ( j ,0) [circle plus] (0, j ) covariant spinors are free from all kinematical acausality. This paradoxical situation is resolved and corrected through the introduction of a constraining principle. The appendix reviews and presents in a unified framework classic works of Schwinger, Weinberg and Wigner regarding the elements of canonical quantum field theory, thus establishing the logical context of our work. 0aQuantum field theory. 0aHigh spin physics. 0aHadrons. 4aMajor physics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aErnst, David J.,edegree supervisor.1 aArnowitt, Richard L.,edegree committee member.1 aKo, Che-Ming,edegree committee member.1 aNatowitz, Joseph B.,edegree committee member.1 aSmith, Roger A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1277005zLink to OAKTrust copy4 uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744882901&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsa81f9cd2-4f25-37c7-adc8-9f11779c1309i76d7217a-f3b8-3083-a856-a5056b25e30903281cam a2200517Ii 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035002000095040005100115035001900166043001200185049000900197099002900206100002400235245010800259264004600367300005200413336002600465337002800491338002700519502002700546500001000573504005600583500004700639520112000686650002301806650004501829650002501874650007101899650005101970650004002021650004902061651003702110650003602147655002702183700004002210700004302250700004302293700004302336710005802379856007802437856015702515994001202672999007902684in0000062462220190325091947.0780802s1977    txua     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm04105442  a(OCoLC)04105442  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)4105442  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1977aDissertationaM6491 aMiller, John Allen.12aA computer simulation of populations of the horn fly, Haematobia irritans (L.) /cby John Allen Miller. 1a[College Station, Tex.] :bMiller,c1977.  ax, 108 leaves :billustrations, graphs ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  cTexas A & M University  aVita.  aIncludes bibliographical references (leaves 77-83).  a"Major subject: Agricultural Engineering."3 aThe survival of the immature stages of the horn fly, Haematobia irratians (L.), in manure droppings was studied under field conditions in Central Texas during the 1972 and 1973 horn fly seasons. The effect of interspecific and intraspecific competition on survival from egg to adult was observed. Within each of two groups of manure droppings, one protected and the other fully exposed to competitors and predators, eggs were seeded at densities of 50, 200, and 800 eggs per dropping. The percentage of eggs that produced adults was determined for each dripping within each group. Temperature and moisture conditions during development from egg to adult were monitored. Interspecific competition significantly reduced survival of the immature stages of the horn fly. Average survival during the horn fly season (March-October) in protected droppings was approximately 14 percent; whereas, survival in droppings fully exposed to competition and predation was reduced to approximately 2.8 percent. However intraspecific competition in the range of 50 to 800 eggs per dropping did not significantly influence survival. 0aHorn flyxControl. 0aAnimal populationsxMathematical models. 0aComputer simulation. 7aAnimal populationsxMathematical models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00809331 7aComputer simulation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00872518 7aHorn fly.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00960277 7aHorn flyxControl.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00960278 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 4aMajor agricultural engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStewart, R.

The concept of Just in Time (JIT) involves elements of all three and has received considerable acceptance as a competitive tactic for manufacturers. As with any process improvement effort, managers attempting to use JIT based processes are faced with the dilemma of how to allocate fixed resources among competing projects. The resource allocation process is complicated by the present deficiencies of standard accounting practices associated with managerial accounting. Many of these deficiencies are overcome through the use of a managerial project selection, justification and evaluation methodology based on a hybrid decision model that uses organizational goals and engineering economics. Additionally, this methodology allows for the comparison of EI versus capital equipment projects. A case study was performed using the methodology in an electronics batch manufacturing environment. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aBennett, G.K.,edegree supervisor.1 aWoodman, Richard W.,edegree committee member.1 aShannon, Robert E.,edegree committee member.1 aEllis, Newton C.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900441&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust Copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1552112zLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 0 OTHER HOLDINGSffsfa8789e1-e322-397b-aba2-670258c214bdi78f9820f-5113-3f6f-8343-bba29a6987f003277ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100002700223245006700250264001000317300004500327336002600372337002800398338002700426504004100453500001000494502004100504500004900545520136300594650002401957650001901981650002302000650003802023655002702061700003702088700004702125700005002172700004502222710005802267856016902325856007802494856015602572994001202728999007902740in0000124237420200904152718.0950614s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32651152  9AGS9222AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32651152  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaP9461 aPrice, Scott McDonald.12aA comprehensive land development strategy :ba learning tool / 1c1993.  axi, 171 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Unfortunately, the current processes fail to incorporate social, political, economic, and environmental issues into a single comprehensive paradigm. To accommodate this need, the disciplines of architectural design, urban planning, and land development were integrated to create an inclusive definition of land development. A definition that describes a successful strategy as one that is environmentally possible, ethnologically adoptable, and economically gainful. Using this definition as a foundation for comparison, a single land development project was used as the analytical point of departure for three distinct design/planning Studios. Each Studio extensively evaluated the proposal by identifying the relationships between process and form. The products from each Studio were analyzed to determine their contributions within the defined context of a successful strategy. These contributions were then incorporated into a comprehensive paradigm representing a greater sensitivity toward environmental and ethnological issues, while at the same time, recognizing the necessity for economic success. 0aLand usexPlanning. 0aCity planning. 0aRegional planning. 4aMajor urban and regional science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aRodiek, Jon,edegree supervisor.1 aHill, Rodney C.,edegree committee member.1 aHinojosa, Jesus H.,edegree committee member.1 aWebb, L.

The population of the study consisted of all students enrolled in Agriscience 101, "Introduction to World Agricultural Science and Technology," or Agriscience 102, "Applied Agricultural Science and Technology," in Texas public schools during the Fall semester, 1991. A stratified random sample of agricultural science programs was selected and surveyed using a data collection instrument. Descriptive statistics were used for reporting the personal and situational characteristics of the respondents. Scales measuring reasons for enrolling, barriers to enrollment, and attitudes about agriculture were determined by using the literature, factor analysis, and SPSSX procedure RELIABILITY. Relationships among selected characteristics and scales were determined by product-moment, point-biserial, and Spearman's rho correlation coefficients. Comparisons between groups of selected characteristics and reasons for enrolling, barriers to enrollment, and perceptions of agriculture were made by analyses of variance. The major findings of this study were as follows: 1. A majority of AGSC 101 and 102 students and teachers were White males. Minority students, especially minority females, were underrepresented. 2. Minority students tended to be from non-farm, non-rural areas more so than non-minority students. 3. Minority students had more negative perceptions regarding agriculture and agricultural education. They were more likely to perceive their reasons for enrolling as being out of their control. They perceived more barriers to enrolling than non-minority students. They were also less likely to see opportunities for themselves in agricultural careers or to perceive agriculture as diverse... 0aAgriculturexStudy and teaching (Secondary)zTexas. 0aAgricultural studentsxAttitudes. 0aMinoritiesxAttitudes. 4aMajor agricultural education. 7aAgriculturexStudy and teaching (Secondary)2fast0(OCoLC)fst00801683 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLarke, Alvin,edegree supervisor.1 aBriers, Gary E.,edegree committee member.1 aCorrigan, Dean C.,edegree committee member.1 aHerring, Don R.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1354157zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744686881&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs04a66cef-0f44-34f9-baaf-eba767fb40d7i79322338-d7da-349f-9c82-750d009bf2e604098ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002000218245008900238264001000327300004400337336002600381337002800407338002700435500002800462502004100490500001000531504004100541500005200582520226300634650003002897650004002927650002902967650004102996655002703037700004203064700004803106700005103154700005203205710005803257856007803315856015603393994001203549999007903561in0000112812220200904152639.0930402s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27843761  9AFW7761AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27843761  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaT2461 aTaylor, Vonnie.10aSocial exchange in bureaucracies :bnegotiation processes in business environments / 1c1992.  ax, 292 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

There seems to be a lack of emphasis on the complex nature of the process and on potential problems that can abound when the researcher reaches the stage of negotiating entry. This research presents a basis for identifying organizations and gatekeepers that would tend to be most and least likely to grant access to researchers wanting to do a naturalistic study. The theoretical basis for identifying the organizations and gatekeepers is found in P. M. Blau's theory of social exchange. The theory asserts that, in the exchange relationship, each actor's actions are dependent on those of the other actor. The actions are oriented towards ends that can only be achieved through interaction with the other person. When exchanges are reciprocated, social bonding and further exchanges result. The reciprocity moves the actors toward power balance. Unreciprocated exchanges give rise to differentiation, which creates power imbalances. The study unfolded in two phases. In Phase I, a research project was designed to study the power associations of addicts in bureaucratic organizations. When attempts to gain access for the purpose of conducting naturalistic research failed, a second research project (Phase II) was initiated. Phase II followed the naturalistic paradigm. The case studies from the failed attempts were developed to provide thick descriptive data. Then, the literature on gaining access was reviewed in an attempt to explain the phenomenon that occurred in Phase I. The findings that emerged from the research indicated that gaining entry to an organization may be facilitated by understanding the needed exchanges or reciprocal negotiations involved. Too often, in trying to do rigorous research, the researcher attempts to maintain control in the same way the organization designs its structure to maintain control. In so doing cooperation is sidestepped and the process of gaining entry becomes a win/lose battle to gain control, with the researcher, at least sometimes, being the loser. 0aOrganizational sociology. 0aBureaucracyxPsychological aspects. 0aNegotiation in business. 4aMajor adult and extension education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBonham, Adrianne,edegree supervisor.1 aBeatty, Paulette,edegree committee member.1 aErlandson, David A.,edegree committee member.1 aMcIntosh, William A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1293014zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747448381&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs172791d8-f71e-36bd-a231-c13fdf9dcb41i7a64d07c-15ad-3687-8ccf-8f22a51ca2fd04025ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100003800209245005700247264001000304300004500314336002600359337002800385338002700413504004100440500001000481502004100491500003200532520224800564650002102812655002702833700004102860700005002901700004802951700005202999710005803051856016903109856007803278856015603356994001203512999007903524in0000128771120200904152709.0960329s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34490658  9AGX7138AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34490658  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaH8691 aHoyt, Jill Kathleen Young,d1960-10aMineral nutrition in resting and exercising horses / 1c1993.  axi, 116 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Horses were placed in wood metabolism stalls during the last four d of each experimental period for total fecal and urine collections. Copper absorption did not change as zinc intake increased, ranging from 42.2% to 50.7% of intake. Two experiments were conducted to quantify mineral losses in exercising horses. In the first experiment, four Miniature Horses were fed diets consisting of oats and Bermudagrass hay. During the first experimental period, horses were maintained at rest and were placed in wooden metabolism stalls for total collections during the last four d. During the second period, horses were galloped 6.1 km daily. Horses were again maintained in metabolism stalls during the last four d for total collections. Sweat loss was quantified and samples were collected. As intake increased with exercise, fecal excretion of minerals increased, and urinary excretion of sodium, calcium, potassium and chloride decreased, possibly to compensate for minerals lost in sweat. Dietary calcium and phosphorus was adequate to meet the needs of exercising horses, but sodium, potassium and chloride supplementation was indicated. In the next experiment, eight Thoroughbred horses were used in a replicated 4X4 Latin square experiment to verify previous results and to examine effects of feeding a fat-supplemented diet on electrolyte balance. Rations contained electrolyte concentrations as indicated from the previous study. Horses were exercised at two workloads to increase energy requirements approximately 150% and 200%. During the last 4 d of each period, horses were housed in metabolism crates for total collections. Sweat loss was quantified and samples were collected. There were no demonstrated effects on electrolyte balance in horses consuming a fat-supplemented versus a conventional ration. Horses were in near electrolyte balance when fed the concentrations of electrolytes as determined in the previous study. This study indicates that to maintain exercising horses in electrolyte balance, diets should contain 1.3 g sodium, 3.1 g chloride, and 4.5 g potassium/Mcal DE. 4aMajor nutrition. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPotter, Gary D.,edegree supervisor.1 aAnderson, James G.,edegree committee member.1 aGreene, L.

Indian River male broiler chicks were used for all experiments. In experiment 1, a 4 x 4 factorial design was utilized consisting of 4 levels of dietary protein (16, 20, 24 and 28%) and 4 levels of dietary energy (2970, 3120, 3265 and 3410 kcal ME/kg). These diets were replicated twice and fed to 40 birds/pen for 21 days. The quadratic growth function best describing growth during the starter phase was: BW = 38.28013 + .62604*P + .172768 *E - .009532*P^2 - . 000047201*E^2 + .001238*P*E, where BW = grams body weight; P = grams cumulative protein consumption; and E = Kcal cumulative energy consumption. In experiment 2, three economical starter diets selected from experiment 1 were fed for 21 days after which nine diets in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement (16, 20 and 24% protein and 3120, 3265 and 3410 kcal ME/kg) were fed for another 21 days. The grower diets were thus replicated 3 times. The quadratic growth function best describing growth through the grower phase was BW = 36.068398 + 1.727053*P + .103206*E - .000072981*P^2 + .000001109*E^2 - .000092706*P*E. This quadratic growth function was not suitable for use in a least cost quadratic programming model because of the positive coefficient describing the quadratic effects of cumulative calorie intake. In experiment 3, nine pens were allocated to each of three economical starter and grower diets selected from the previous two experiments. These diets were fed for 42 days after which finisher diets consisting of 16, 20 and 24% protein and 3120, 3265 and 3410 kcal ME/kg were fed for another 14 days in a 3 x 3 factorial design. The quadratic growth function best describing growth through the finisher phase was BW = 55.447192 + 1.265325*P + .107697*E - .001466*P^2 - .000007127*E^2 + .000165*P*E. This quadratic function accurately predicts growth throughout 8 weeks of broiler production and appears suitable for use in a least cost quadratic programming model. 0aPoultryxFeeding and feeds. 0aProteins in animal nutrition. 0aFoodxCaloric content. 0aQuadratic programming. 4aMajor poultry science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBailey, C.

This researcher used an adaptation of Ajzen and Fishbein's (1980) conceptual framework for the prediction of specific intentions and behaviors in conjunction with Cross's (1981) Chain-of-Response Model as a basis for investigating barriers and incentives to participation in CPE. The sample for this study was derived from the registered and/or certified nuclear medicine technologists, registered radiographers, and registered diagnostic medical sonographers in the state of Texas. The data were collected using the CPE Questionnaire and CPE Survey/Personal Data instrument which was developed for this study. Survey/Personal Data instrument which was developed for this study. The statistical methodology employed in this study was multiple linear regression. After controlling for all other variables in the final regression model, there were four major predictors of CPE participation for these imaging technologists and sonographers. In descending order of importance, the best predictors were: (a) the construct scale of institutional provider access barriers (cost, travel distance, and transportation problems); (b) work modality; (c) population of employment city; and (d) ethnicity. In addition, four independent variables had a tendency to influence CPE participation after controlling for all other variables in the final regression model. In descending order of positive influence were the construct scale of dispositional incentives and educational enrollment. In descending order of negative influence were the construct scale of institutional employer incentives and the institutional provider availability barrier. 0aBiomedical techniciansxTraining of. 0aDiagnostic imagingxStudy and teaching (Continuing education) 0aBiomedical techniciansxAttitudes. 4aMajor adult and extension education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBeatty, Paulette T.,edegree supervisor.1 aAlbanese, Robert,edegree committee member.1 aFinlay, Barbara,edegree committee member.1 aSweeney, Donald A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1276996zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745674891&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs4bd88cc8-5749-34bb-8a2d-7f7987b66724i7cf4a0eb-9867-3646-9216-3c8095256f5a04286ctm a2200445Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100001900223245006400242264001000306300004700316336002600363337002800389338002700417500002800444502006200472500001000534504005800544520254800602650002603150650002203176650002303198650002903221655002703250700004203277700004603319700004703365700004703412710005803459856007603517856015603593994001203749999007903761in0000002058320190325090710.0880716s1987    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm18228095  9AAB3508AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)18228095  aTXAM  a1987aDissertationaH8741 aHsu, Tung-wen.10aStudy of marine sediment drag forces on offshore pipelines. 1c1987.  axiii, 171 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

These sediment movements produce forces on ocean structures, such as offshore platforms and marine pipelines, which are sufficient to fail the structures. Previous research had shown that the sediments exhibited viscoelastic characteristics in which the shear modulus could be expressed as a power law in time. This implies that the drag forces produced by sediments moving past marine structures will be a function of the relative velocity of movement between the sediment and the structure. Tests were performed to determine the drag forces produced by moving sediment on deep, shallow and partially buried model pipelines. The results were expressed in terms of generalized force coefficients, g[subscript i] which are independent of the sediment velocity, sediment shear strength and pipe dimensions. Two "drag" boxes were utilized to study various effects such as the sediment flow angle, total pressure, sediment shear strength and pipe surface roughness on the generalized force coefficients. Results showed that the drag forces normal to the pipe increased with depth of burial, as might be expected, until a burial depth of six to seven times the pipe diameter was reached, at which point the drag forces became constant. Axial drag forces were much smaller than the normal drag forces and reached a constant value when burial depths exceeded twice the pipe diameter. Other findings were that increases in total pressure produced increases in normal forces at burial depths greater than two pipe diameters, whereas axial forces were not affected. For burial depths less than one pipe diameter, increases of external pressure produced smaller axial and normal forces depending on the amount and duration of the pressure. At shallow burial depths, freely rotated pipes produced no surface roughness effect at failure points; however, clamped pipes exhibited somewhat higher normal forces for roughened surfaces. At large displacements, after pipe-sediment separation, roughness effects were minor. Results of the drag tests on pipes are compared with existing theoretical predictions for various cases of separation at the interface between the pipe and the sediment. The theoretical predictions for no separation compared closely with the experimental results for deeply buried pipes under the highest total pressures. Other theoretical cases of separation compared closely with actual results for shallow and partially buried pipe. 0aUnderwater pipelines. 0aMarine sediments. 0aOcean engineering. 4aMajor civil engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDunlap, Wayne A.,edegree supervisor.1 aSchapery, Richard A.,edegree supervisor.1 aCoyle, Harry W.,edegree committee member.1 aSmith, Kirby C.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/Dissertations-26998zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=749634491&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to ProQuest copy  aC0bTXAffs5d175447-3a4e-385e-ac43-f0b3ac10c5dbi7d784a74-1dfe-33b8-9c3a-1aac68100a2f02700ctm a22005415a 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002000072035001400092040002200106049001500128099002800143100003300171245006800204264008100272300004800353336002600401337002800427338002700455504004100482500001000523502004000533500004500573520006700618520006300685520006600748520006100814520006600875520006600941520006701007520006201074520006601136520006601202520006401268520006601332520006601398520005701464520006601521520006601587520006001653520006701713520006401780520005901844650003401903856013301937999000902070999007902079in0000131195720190325093127.0960624s1994    xx a     b    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)34981476  9AHA9198AM  aTXAcTXAdUtOrBLW  aTXAMaTXAR  a1994aDissertationaK661 aKlughart, Kevin Mark,d1959-12aA unified MOSFET drain current model /cby Kevin Mark Klughart. 1a[Place of publication not identified] :b[publisher not identified] ;c1994.  axvii, 184 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

A packet of questionnaires containing a demographic information sheet, the Personality Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ), the Anima-Animus Scale (AAS), the Measures of Psychosocial Development (MPD), the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, the Singer-Loomis Inventory of Personality (SLIP), and the Short Index of Self-Actualization were individually and anonymously administered to 114 female flight attendants who ranged in age from 21 to 50 (M age = 32). Using a mean-split on the masculine-feminine and animus-anima scales of the PAQ and AAS, respectively, subjects were classified into four categories of androgyny (androgynous, masculine, feminine, and undifferentiated) and four anima-animus categories (developed anima/animus (DAA), animus, anima, and undeveloped anima-animus (UAA). Androgyny and the anima-animus were both found to correlate with increased personality development; and, although androgyny and the anima-animus constructs were significantly correlated (r. = .45, p. < .001), they appeared to be independent. Generally, the results for the androgynous categories paralleled previous research; however, the results for the anima-animus categories produced mixed results. Similar to the androgynous classifications, DAA and UAA generally scored highest and lowest (respectively) on all of the dependent variables. While their scores were not significantly different, anima subjects scored higher than animus subjects on psychosocial development and individuation while animus subjects scored higher than anima subjects on self-actualization and self-esteem. Post hoc analyses of the MPD and SLIP revealed divergent response patterns between masculine/feminine and animus/anima categories.

In chapter II, a proof of trace theorem for the range \ < s < | and s > f is first given. In Chapter III, the regularities of S in L p and the relations between ( ± | / + /C) -1 and ( ± | I + £ * ) -1 are obtained. Furtherm ore, new regularities of 1C and 1C* on sm ooth domains in aft3 are found, which reveal that 5, rC and JC* have the same regularities on smooth boundaries. In C hapter IV, a new approach based on the potential theory and variational m ethod is proposed to study the linear quadratic regulator problems (LQR) governed by the elliptic equation on Lipschitz domains with point observations on boundary. The LQR problems with or without control constraints are completely solved in this work. The regularities of optim al controls and states and the explicit expressions of optimal controls are derived. The singularities in optim al controls are displayed explicitely through decomposition formulas. Finally in C hapter V, a gradient-truncation m ethod and an iterative truncation m ethod have been developed to com pute optimal controls of (LQR) problems. The test problems show th at both m ethods are insensitive to the partition of boundary. It is found th a t the classical Lagrangian m ultiplier method may fail to provide reliable numerical algorithm on our (LQR) problems. 4aMajor mathematics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aChen, Goong,edegree supervisor.1 aZhou, Jianxin,edegree supervisor.1 aBoas, Harold P.,edegree committee member.1 aKinra, V.

Specifically, this investigation seeks to determine how personal involvement, defined here in terms of Crano's (in press) model of vested interest, affects message processing under different conditions of personal relevance, defined here as perceived risk of misfortune. It is suggested that personal relevance and personal involvement may interact and produce unique affects on message processing. In this investigation, participants were randomly assigned to read either a strong or weak message regarding the chosen misfortune and to complete a variety of questionnaires assessing their attitudes toward the topic. Under conditions of high levels of personal relevance, high personal involvement subjects proved more susceptible to a weak message than low personal involvement individuals. Specifically, high risk/high vested interest people appeared to be engaged in danger control processing because they were willing to accept a message that advocated prevention of a misfortune (i.e., an adaptive response to a threat) , even though the basis of the arguments were weak and specious. High risk/low vested interest individuals, on the other hand, appeared to be engaged in fear control processing because they were not willing to accept a weak and specious message that advocated prevention of a misfortune (i.e., a defensive response to deny a threat). The danger and fear control processing found in the high personal relevance condition was not evident among low personal relevance individuals who received weak messages. That is, people of low risk/high vested interest did not scrutinize a weak message more than low risk/low vested interest subjects. This suggests that the lower personal relevance of the low risk condition attenuates the effects of personal involvement (i.e., vested interest). These results suggest that only under conditions of high personal relevance does personal involvement (i.e., vested interest) influence message processing. 0aHuman information processing. 0aPersuasion (Psychology) 0aAttitude (Psychology) 0aAttitude change. 4aMajor psychology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aCrano, William D.,edegree supervisor.1 aSell, Jane A.,edegree committee member.1 aSimpson, Jeffry A.,edegree committee member.1 aWood, Wendy,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1354119zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744912591&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs41de7b85-ce3e-3b39-80e3-b3fff6914c63i7fc683c4-1407-38e9-a9a7-4334c767f9b003740ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099003000189100002700219245007400246264001000320300004500330336002600375337002800401338002700429500002800456502004100484500001000525504004100535500004400576520189400620650002002514650002902534650003102563650003302594655002702627700004402654700004302698700004702741700004802788700005102836710005802887856007802945856015603023994001203179999007903191in0000111391620200904152551.0930105s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27197070  9AFV6354AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27197070  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaH87351 aHsu, Shih-Tein,d1951-10aOn a robust controller design using a minimax optimization approach / 1c1991.  aix, 173 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The resulting system is optimal under the worst case of norm-bounded initial condition uncertainty, norm-bounded deterministic noise, and norm-bounded parameter uncertainty. The uncertainties are modelled such that we can formulate the problem as a zero-sum, two-sided minimax game. The minimax solution is proved to be a saddle point solution under either the positivity of control-disturbance authority, or the strict concavity of the open loop system. The existence of the solution is proven by using the successive approximation technique. The theory considers both finite dimensional and infinite dimensional systems. By using the trace operator of the product of two Hilbert-Schmidt operators, all the matrix theory in the finite dimensional minimax control theory can be extended to distributed parameter systems. A finite dimensional approximation scheme also is developed. It is proven that the minimax solution of the infinite dimensional problem can exactly be specified by a convergent sequence of minimax solutions of finite dimensional approximations of the problem. Examples that provide verification of the theory presented in this dissertation include (1) scalar minimax controller design, (2) finite dimensional output feedback minimax robust controller design, and (3) minimax controller design of a parabolic heat problem by spline approximation. The contribution of the dissertation is (1) to broaden the application of minimax control theory and make it a straightforward engineering tool for robust controller design by using eigenvalue sensitivity approach and (2) to show the feasibility of finite dimensional approximation of the worst case distributed parameter system robust control. 0aControl theory. 0aChebyshev approximation. 0aMathematical optimization. 4aMajor aerospace engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKurdila, Andrew J.,edegree supervisor.1 aChen, Goong,edegree committee member.1 aHuang, Garng M.,edegree committee member.1 aJunkins, John L.,edegree committee member.1 aVadali, Srinivas R.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1282516zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746227901&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs22c7f0a7-668f-3fb9-b63d-66e204e3c086i7fed4c77-208b-3b3e-9d5e-170f4efe890e03783ctm a22003375a 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002000072035001400092037001800106040002200124049001500146099002800161100002500189245013200214264008100346300004700427336002600474337002800500338002700528504004100555500001000596502004000606500004400646530006200690520243900752650003303191856013303224999000903357999007903366in0000130525720190325093134.0960628s1995    xx a     b    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)35004581  9AHB1329AM  a95-34334bUMI  aTXAcTXAdUtOrBLW  aTXAMaTXAR  a1995aDissertationaE471 aElrafie, Emad Ahmed.10aEvaluation of horizontal wells with transverse hydraulic fractures in a layered multi-phase reservoir /cby Emad Ahmed Elrafie. 1a[Place of publication not identified] :b[publisher not identified] ;c1995.  axvi, 192 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Although these reservoirs have been penetrated with numerous wellbores (for developing deeper horizons), they have not been commercially productive with conventional vertical wells.  These reservoirs can be characterized as two thin, low permeability layers with no crossflow between them. Productivity of these reservoirs is reduced by gas blocking behavior when attempting to produce below the bubble point pressure. The objective of this work was to investigate the viability of converting existing conventional vertical wells to horizontal wells with multiple transverse fractures. These fractures will not only significantly increase the productivity, but also provide the vertical communication needed between the reservoir layers. Reservoir simulation was used to evaluate various combinations of transverse fractures in horizontal wells.  These results were compared with simulation results for conventional vertical wells, with and without vertical fractures.  Only infinite conductivity fractures were considered.  Early transient behavior as well as pseudosteadystate behavior were simulated.  An economical analysis was made for the horizontal wells with multiple transverse fractures. The results show that horizontal wells with transverse fractures appear to make production of the Upper Baharlyla reservoirs economically feasible. In this work, the productivity index has been presented for horizontal wells with various combinations of transverse fractures, producing from the Upper Bahariyia reservoirs.  It has been shown that the productivity index of horizontal wells with transverse fractures is mainly affected by the distance between the outermost fractures and not by the number of fractures nor the spacing between them.  Between fractures perforations has been shown to have negligible effects on increasing the productivity of horizontal wells with transverse fractures in this reservoir.  Also decline type curves are presented, for vertical fractured and horizontal with transverse fractures wells, for future performance prediction and reserves estimates. Although the conclusions of this work were targeted to provide guidelines for selecting a feasible producing technique for the targeted reservoir, these conclusions can be used in similar multiple layered oil reservoirs. 4aMajor petroleum engineering.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=742160701&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aMARSffs5437c827-9b9f-3090-9c01-9d58b9223c84i8026d23a-8407-3c75-a8ba-ef6ffd23478803582ctm a2200445Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172049000900192099002400201100002400225245006600249264001000315300004500325336002600370337002800396338002700424504004100451500001000492502004100502500004500543520181900588650003102407650004302438650001902481650003402500655002702534700004202561700005402603700005102657700004502708710005802753856007802811856015602889994001203045999007903057in0000116753420200904152627.0940412s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm30130138  9AGF5541AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)30130138  aTXAM  a1992aThesisaL47831 aLee, Insung,d1960-10aRobust tree coding combined with harmonic scaling of speech / 1c1992.  axv, 148 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

A time domain harmonic scaling algorithm (TDHS) is used to compress input speech by a factor of two. This process allows the tree coder to have 2 bits/sample for 6.4 kbps and 1.5 bits/sample for 4.8 kbps in the case of a 6.4 kHz sampling rate. Various window functions and pitch extraction algorithms are compared in the TDHS algorithm. In the backward adaptive tree coder, there are three components of the code generator, including a hybrid adaptive quantizer, a short-term predictor and a pitch predictor. The short-term predictor with a pole-zero structure improves the performance of the tree coder in the error free channel over an all-pole structure. The robustness of the tree coder is achieved by carefully choosing the input of the short-term predictor adaptation. The residual signal shaped by an all-zero filter is used as the input for adaptation. The all-zero filter is obtained by truncating the infinite impulse response of the pole-zero synthesis filter. Another method to improve the robustness of the tree coder is the inclusion of a smoother in the pitch predictor. The coefficients of the smoother with three taps are computed from the estimated autocorrelation function of the pitch synthesizer output. The inclusion of a smoother provides a small improvement in the error free channel and robustness to transmission errors. Subjectively, tree coding combined with TDHS achieves very good quality speech at the rate of 6.4 kbps and good quality speech at 4.8 kbps. The performance of the coding system is evaluated for real speech by means of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), segmental SNR, frequency domain SNR, spectrograms, and informal listening tests. 0aSpeech processing systems. 0aSignal processingxDigital techniques. 0aCoding theory. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGibson, Jerry D.,edegree supervisor.1 aGeorghiades, Costas N.,edegree committee member.1 aGriswold, Norman C.,edegree committee member.1 aHsing, Tailen,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1374767zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746519911&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2a7ecaa3-c8b8-38a9-926f-f226be57d5e5i8042a96a-ddda-391c-aa43-b362186a708703936ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002800209245008400237264001000321300004500331336002600376337002800402338002700430504004100457500001000498502004100508500004300549520212400592650003202716655002702748700004502775700004802820700005002868700004402918710005802962856016903020856007803189856015603267994001203423999007903435in0000127520720200904152649.0960322s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34434477  9AGX3760AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34434477  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaB9681 aBurr, Barry Lea,d1965-10aImproved methods for extracting and recovering asphalts from pavement samples / 1c1993.  axx, 211 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Flaws in previous methods include: 1) the inability to completely remove solvent from recovered asphalt, 2) the inability to completely extract asphalt from the aggregate, and 3) a tendency to alter asphalt properties during extraction. The new methods improve precision and accuracy by minimizing these errors. The new procedures also conserve solvent and require less operator effort. As specified, the standard ASTM solvent removal procedure is not capable of removing all of the extraction solvent from extracted asphalts. Analysis of residual solvent by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) made it possible to determine optimal conditions for solvent recovery such as oil bath temperature, nitrogen flow, vacuum, and recovery time. Both the Abson and Roto-vap methods were studied. Neither provided consistent solvent removal for varying grades of asphalts. After raising recovery temperatures and extending recovery times, both methods were capable of removing all solvent from asphalts having 60°C viscosities of 200,000 poise. During extraction, asphalts are dissolved in strong solvents for several hours. ASTM D-2172B subjects asphalts to dilute solutions of trichloroethylene (TCE) at 80°C for several hours. Exposure to solvents causes hardening and softening of asphalts depending on the concentration and temperature. Solution conditions which result in minimal hardening or softening were determined. The new methods were designed such that asphalts are not exposed to hash solution conditions. Previous methods left up to 10% of the asphalt on the aggregate. This was due to poor mixing and the use of weak solvents. Several solvents were studied for their ability to extract strongly adsorbed material from aggregate fines. TCE with 15% ethanol (TCE/EtOH) and toluene with 15% ethanol (Tol/EtOH) showed good extractibility and were chosen as the extraction solvents for the new methods. The new methods also incorporated continuous mixing of the solvent-aggregate-asphalt slurry... 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDavison, Richard R.,edegree supervisor.1 aBullin, Jerry A.,edegree committee member.1 aGlover, Charles J.,edegree committee member.1 aLetton, Alan,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941071941xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1523725zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745759841&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6163c0f1-035b-33e5-8bd6-2c9c868579c6i81bba937-0998-35a5-b985-3ec7c5dd7ffb04018ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040007700109035002000186043001200206049000900218099002900227100003600256245021500292264001000507300004400517336002600561337002800587338002700615504004100642500001000683502004100693500004500734520153400779610005302313650004302366650008602409650003402495610006802529650006202597650004102659651003702700655002702737700004102764700005002805700004602855700004702901710005802948856016903006856007803175856015603253994001203409999007903421in0000121711020200904152706.0950417s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32321131  9AGS1378AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdOCLCAdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdTXA  a(OCoLC)32321131  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG6561 aGoodwin, Jeffery Layton,d1957-10aEffects of "What's the Beef/Here's the Beef", an educational program to address animal activist concerns about animal agriculture, on knowledge and attitudes of Texas Agricultural Extension agents-agriculture / 1c1993.  ax, 122 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

This program utilizes the "contrasting viewpoints " method of addressing controversial issues. This study explored a possible method for the Extension Service to provide educational programs to address controversial issues affecting agriculture. In the fall of 1991, a sample of 126 county Extension agents of the Texas Agricultural Extension Service were exposed to the experimental treatment and compared to a control group of 132 of their peers. A posttest-only control group design was employed in this study. Measures of attitudes and subject matter knowledge possessed by the subjects were the dependent variables and provided the basis for the core findings and conclusions. The major findings of the study were that a higher subject matter knowledge and more moderate attitudes regarding animal activist concerns about animal agriculture were possessed by subjects who were exposed to the experimental treatment (as compared to the control group) . It was concluded that the What's the Beef/Here's the Beef education program and the "contrasting viewpoints" method were effective in increasing subject matter knowledge and moderating attitudes of Extension agents - agriculture. Furthermore, agents expressed satisfaction with the program. They also believed that they could make use of the materials/program in their respective home counties and that additional similar programs should be developed.20aTexas Agricultural Extension ServicexEmployees. 0aAnimal welfarezTexasxPublic opinion. 0aAgricultural extension workersxStudy and teaching (Continuing education)zTexas. 4aMajor agricultural education.27aTexas Agricultural Extension Service.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00540792 7aAnimal welfarexPublic opinion.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00809448 7aEmployees.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00909111 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBriers, Gary E.,edegree supervisor.1 aFehlis, Chester P.,edegree committee member.1 aFriend, Ted H.,edegree committee member.1 aHerring, Don R.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932872641xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1475135zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747668041&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs601d751c-155b-3f03-a6a6-24690a4b2752i837d42e9-0f95-32b4-b9ba-92fdab37dc3403824ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002700209245008200236264001000318300004500328336002600373337002800399338002700427504004100454500001000495502004100505500003800546520202700584650002702611655002702638700004102665700004802706700004702754700004902801710005802850856016902908856007803077856015603155994001203311999007903323in0000128314320200904152657.0960328s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34482925  9AGX6000AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34482925  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaD9991 aDzama, Kennedy,d1963-10aGenetic simulation of beef cattle production for growth and milk production / 1c1993.  axiv, 88 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The traits simulated were birth weight, yearling weight, mature weight and milk production. In the original model genetic potentials were specified by growth rate, mature weight and milk production. The progeny inherited these traits from the dam with no contribution from the sire. The model was modified so that the progeny inherited attributes from both the sire and the dam. The incorporation of genetics into the model allowed for the introduction of variation among individuals and from generation to generation. This was achieved by interfacing the original model with stochastic genetic subroutines. The variation introduced in the simulated populations was used to examine different selection scenarios. Application of restricted selection index for desired genetic change, developed by Yamada et al. (1975), was examined. The index included birth weight and yearling weight. Correlated gains in mature weight and milk production were also studied. This allowed for comparison of different selection objectives in different genotypes. Five within herd selection experiments were carried out to illustrate the model. Selection index methods using birth weight and yearling weight resulted in more gain in all traits compared to single trait selection on yearling weight. During selection for birth weight and yearling weight dystocia patterns were also examined. Dystocia patterns in the small moderate-sized breed were similar to those in the large breed when mature size was increased. In the small to moderate-sized breed selection on yearling weight alone resulted in the low dystocia levels while selection for reduced birth weight in the large breed actually reduced dystocia levels. Analysis of selection response for birth weight and yearling weight over twenty years of simulation using simple linear regression yielded results that were in general agreement with expected gains computed a priori. 4aMajor animal breeding. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWalter, John P.,edegree supervisor.1 aPierce, Wayne B.,edegree committee member.1 aRuvuna, Francis,edegree committee member.1 aSanders, James O.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941076241xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1525886zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745760001&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsb5ee3827-b91f-3b66-b94c-cd54d6701dbbi8387ec22-9022-3e65-a1ea-884b4042a74304320ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100004200223245012200265264001000387300004400397336002600441337002800467338002700495500002800522502004100550500001000591504004100601500003300642520231100675650002602986650002303012650001703035650002203052655002703074700004303101700004903144700005403193700005103247710005803298856016903356856007803525856015603603994001203759999007903771in0000104301920200904152519.0910905s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24335386  9AFG7527AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)24335386  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaM1171 aMcAuslane, Heather J.q(Heather Jane)10aHost microhabitat location by Campoletis sonorensis (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), a generalist parasitoid / 1c1990.  aix, 78 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Microhabitat location was influenced by visual cues from the host plant. Parasitoids located a cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum L.) more readily than a single cotton leaf. Damaged cotton plants provided chemical cues and neither experienced nor naive parasitoids flew to undamaged plants. Experienced females completed equal numbers of flights to mechanically damaged leaves and to naturally damaged leaves either with host frass and Heliothis virescens (F.) larvae (host/plant complex) or without host larvae. Naive parasitoids completed fewer flights than experienced females but exhibited the same specificity. Parasitization experience consisted of oviposition in hosts and exposure to damaged plants and to host frass. Oviposition caused experienced females to complete more flights than naive females and was as effective in stimulating flight as contact with all three factors. Females contacting frass or damaged plants, without oviposition, completed fewer flights than naive females with no contact with kairomones. Cotton seedlings released green leaf chemicals and terpenes. Headspace collections from damaged and undamaged plants were different and may account for the increased attractiveness of damaged plants to C. sonorensis. Undamaged plants produced small amounts of volatiles compared to damaged plants but no new chemicals were detected after damage. Parasitoids reared on hosts fed plant material were no more responsive to host/plant complex odors than were parasitoids reared from hosts fed artificial diet. The diet of the host did not affect the parasitoid's microhabitat preference. Parasitoids given oviposition experience 1 min prior to bioassay completed more flights than did naïve females to two host plants, cotton and sesame (Sesamum indicum L.), and to a nonhost plant, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). However, after 24 h, only females experienced on potato responded at levels significantly higher than naive females indicating that females learned the novel odor of the nonhost. Parasitoids did not prefer one hose plant over another but did prefer a host to a nonhost plant. A single oviposition experience did not change host microhabitat preference. 0aInsectsxHost plants. 0aHabitat selection. 0aHymenoptera. 4aMajor entomology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aVinson, Bradleigh,edegree supervisor.1 aHarris, Marvin K.,edegree committee member.1 aSterling, Winifield L.,edegree committee member.1 aWilliams, Howard J.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911827141xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1190579zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746213821&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs0435cace-a97d-356e-8bc5-fece7b74ea1ei878f8e18-ceda-33a7-9228-e1db0f8666fc02812ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004400109035002000153049000900173099002900182100003900211245010500250264001000355300002900365336002600394337002800420338002700448504004100475500001000516502004100526500003000567520113200597650001901729655002701748700004101775700004601816700004701862700005001909700004801959710005802007856007802065856015602143994001202299999007902311in0000126647820200904152711.0960305s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34311999  9AGX0097AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34311999  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaK2951 aKelsch, Anne Airth-Kindree,d1965-10aPoliticians, the press and power :bLord Beaverbrook's introduction to British politics, 1910-1918 / 1c1993.  avii, 298 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Within months of emigrating from Canada to Britain, he became an M.P. and a consort of the Tory elite. His character and methods suited behind-the-scenes maneuvering. Historians have credited him with masterminding manipulations at several decisive junctures in British history: most notably Bonar Law's accession to the leadership of the Conservative Party in 1911 and the pulling together the men who toppled Asquith from power in 1916. The primary objective of this research is to determine Lord Beaverbrook's appropriate place in the history of Britain during the years 1910-1918 which encapsulate a revolutionary phase in Beaverbrook's life. In those eight years Max Aitken evolved from an upstart colonial financier to a notable Conservative politico and, ultimately, a notorious press baron. This dissertation is the first work to seriously consider Beaverbrook's role as a constructive politician. As such it reveals much about the nature of Edwardian politics and about the Conservative Party's attempts to adapt to the demands of a changing electorate. 4aMajor history. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAdams, R.

The study was conducted during the academic year beginning in the fall of 1989 and ending in the spring of 1990. The population was fourth grade teachers in the State of Texas employed during that time. The sample was all fourth grade teachers at 300 schools selected at random. Descriptive statistics were used to report personal and professional characteristics of the teachers as well as their tendencies to teach agriculture, use of concepts related to agriculture in their teaching, and their preference in assistance programs to help them teach about agriculture. Frequencies and percentages were computed and used to develop a profile of the teachers. Correlational techniques were used to determine and measure relationships between and among personal and professional characteristics of the teachers as well as their tendencies to teach agriculture, use concepts related to agriculture in their teaching, and their preference in assistance programs to help them teach about agriculture. Comparative techniques were used to detect differences between teachers based upon their personal and professional characteristics. The major findings of the study were as follows: (1) Fourth grade teachers had few background characteristics that involved agriculture. (2) Teachers had an unacceptably low knowledge about agriculture. (3) Almost all fourth grade teachers perceived agriculture to be farming and ranching only. (4) Most teachers taught about agriculture or used agricultural concepts in teaching. (5) The primary source of materials teachers used to teach about agriculture was chapters related to agriculture in text books. (6) Teachers were most interested in assistance programs that are less structured and allow them to work on their own. (7) Of the more highly structured assistance programs, teachers preferred short non-credit workshops to longer non-credit workshops, and graduate courses for three credit hours to graduate courses worth less credit. (8) Teachers who had training in certain agricultural education programs had greater knowledge about and more accurate perceptions of agriculture. 0aAgricultural educationzTexas. 0aAgriculturexStudy and teachingzTexas. 0aEducation, ElementaryzTexas. 7aAgricultural education.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00800702 7aAgriculturexStudy and teaching.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00801669 7aEducation, Elementary.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00902945 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 4aMajor agricultural education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHerring, Don R.,edegree supervisor.1 aLarke, Alvin,edegree supervisor.1 aBriers, Gary E.,edegree committee member.1 aWiseman, Donna L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910700241xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1097396zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744834981&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2de2e55e-29e4-33d6-9737-d051e411f4ffi87dcfc00-bd84-3728-a850-92d4952352f002718cam a2200349K  4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001900095040005600114100002600170245009900196264003600295300001500331336002600346337002800372338002700400502005800427520112200485650003101607655004701638655008301685700004201768700004601810700004801856710010501904856007702009856015602086994001202242948003502254999007902289in0000017295020190325091226.0791204s1970    txu      m    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm05757144  a(OCoLC)5757144  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdTXAdOCLCOdOCLdUtOrBLW1 aSmith, Harry Lincoln.10aRadioisotope maximum permissible concentration calculations employing and IBM 360/65 computer. 1a[College Station, Tex.],c1970.  a411 leaves  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  bPh.

Because of an increase in radioisotope research and uses since 1958 and because of the existence of approximately 1000 radionuclides, additional MPC values were needed. Furthermore, as research yielded newer physical and biological constants, a coherent calculational technique for efficient MPC evaluation became imperative. Based on the existing need for additional MPC values and the availability of new data on which to found MPC value calculation, a three-part computer calculational technique was developed. The computer program consists of a computer logic section written in FORTRAN language, a nine array physical data section, and a multivalued, mutually exclusive biological data section. Using the Texas ASM Data Processing Center IBM 360/65 Computer, approximately 900 radionuclide MPC values were calculated. Agreement between the previously published ICRP Committee II MPC values and the new MPC values was generally close. 4aMajor nuclear engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft0http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/gf20140260391 aNeff, Richard D.,edegree supervisor.1 aKlipple, E.

Mother/infant relationships have been most extensively explored from the standpoint of the mother. This study investigated mother/infant and peer bonds formed by Nubian goat kids in the first three months of life. The hypothesis was that the mother/infant bond was stronger than the sibling/sibling bond. An open-field test (n = 22) and a two-choice selection chamber test (n = 30) were used. Each individual was presented both tests, repeated in each of four age classes: (1) 1-3 wks, (2) 4-6 wks, (3) 7-9 wks and (4) 10-12 wks. Preference in the open-field test was determined by proximity during four activities: resting, nursing, grazing and moving. Preferences in the selection chamber were determined by choice in six replicate trials of each choice pair: dam vs. sibling, dam vs. strange kid, strange doe vs. sibling and herdmate kid vs. strange kid. In the open-field test, preference for proximity of sibling was dependent on activity. Resting and nursing always occurred with the sibling. The sibling was preferred during grazing in age class 1 (T = -2.29, P = 0.03) and in age class 4 (T = -3.11, P = 0.005). Grazing was either near a sibling or a herdmate kid. Siblings were not preferred during moving activities. In the chamber test, kids approached either the dam or sibling significantly more frequently than the strange kid or doe. The sibling bond superceded the mother/infant bond in age classes 2 and 3. Preference for herdmate kid over strange kid increased with age. The hypothesis that the mother/infant bond is stronger than the sibling bond was rejected. The mother/infant bond is strong, but is superceded by the sibling bond most of the time. Age-related changes in the mother/infant bond may be related to changes in the ability of the mother to provide milk and in maturing social relationships of the kid. Domestic goats in confinement may differ from their wild relatives in their expression of some behaviours due to the effect of nutrition and limited space. 0aNubian goatxBehavior. 0aGoats. 0aKids (Goats)xBehavior. 4aMajor wildlife and fisheries sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPackard, Jane M.,edegree supervisor.1 aBassett, James W.,edegree supervisor.1 aBowers, David R.,edegree committee member.1 aDixon, James R.,edegree committee member.1 aSlack, R.

D.cTexas A & M Universityd1992  a"Major subject: Nuclear Engineering."3 aA method for applying the discrete ordinates method for solution of the neutron transport equation in arbitrary two-dimensional meshes has been developed. The finite difference approach normally used to approximate spatial derivatives in extrapolating angular fluxes across a cell is replaced by direct solution of the characteristic form of the transport equation for each discrete direction. Thus, computational cells are not restricted to the traditional shape of a mesh element within a given coordinate system. However, in terms of the treatment of energy and angular dependencies, this method resembles traditional discrete ordinates techniques. Using the method developed here, a general two-dimensional space can be approximated by an irregular mesh comprised of arbitrary polygons. The method of characteristics, originally developed to eliminate negative fluxes encountered in many finite difference approximations, had been previously applied to regular cell structures in multiple dimensions and various coordinate systems. In such geometries, the geometrical relationships between sides were determined analytically and incorporated directly into the numerical model. However, the present work makes no assumptions about the orientations or the number of sides in a given cell, and computes all geometric relationships between each set of sides in each cell for each discrete direction. A set of non-reentrant polygons can therefore be used to represent any given two dimensional space. Results for a number of test problems have been compared to solutions obtained from traditional methods, with good agreement. Comparisons include benchmarks against analytical results for problems with simple geometry, as well numerical results obtained from traditional discrete ordinates methods by applying the ANISN and TWOTRAN computer programs. Numerical results were obtained for problems ranging from simple one-dimensional geometry to complicated multidimensional configurations. These results have demonstrated the ability of the developed method to closely approximate complex geometrical configurations and to obtain accurate results for problems that are extremely difficult to model using traditional methods. 0aNeutron transport theoryxNumerical methods. 0aTransport theoryxDiscrete ordinates methods. 4aMajor nuclear engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aParish, Theodore A.,edegree supervisor.1 aAdams, Marvin L.,edegree committee member.1 aBaskharone, Erian A.,edegree committee member.1 aBolch, Wesley E.,edegree committee member.1 aNelson, Paul,edegree committee member.1 aPevey, Ronald E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1449202zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746519481&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2f5f2e5d-551c-3171-ad2f-aa41b6433d1ei8aa97c36-2046-32ec-a5a3-29b1a1aba94304252ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100002500223245008600248264001000334300004600344336002600390337002800416338002700444500002800471502004100499500001000540504004100550500003900591520225400630650002202884650001802906650001302924650002802937655002702965700004102992700004503033700004903078700004503127700004603172710005803218856016903276856007803445856015603523994001203679999007903691in0000104994120200904152607.0911223s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm25011463  9AFJ8201AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)25011463  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaV4611 aVenkatachalam, K.

The bound rubber transferase utilizes the photolabile substrate analogs 2- diazo-3-trifluropropionyloxy-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and 2- diazo-3-trifluropropionyloxy-geranyl pyrophosphate as allylic cosubstrates for the polymerization reaction. Irradiation of the washed rubber particles with UV light in the presence of Mg2+, isopentynyl pyrophosphate and 2-diazo-3-trifluropropionyloxygeranyl pyrophosphate photo inactivates the rubber transferase. Irradiation of the washed rubber particles with UV light in the presence of Mg2+, isopentynyl pyrophosphate and 8 -[3H ]-2- diazo-3-trifluropropionyloxy-geranyl pyrophosphate labels mainly a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 52,000 as determined by the separation of the extracted protein by sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bound rubber transferase was solubilized from the rubber particles with 3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate and purified. A 52 kD protein represented as a major protein in the sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These studies, together with the photoaffinity labeling studies, tentatively show the molecular weight of the purified bound rubber transferase to be 52,000. The purified rubber transferase catalyzed the formation of a high molecular weight rubber polymer. Washed rubber particles isolated from Hevea brasiliensis contain a tightly bound rubber transferase capable of catalyzing the de novo synthesis of polyisoprene. Experiments with photoprobe substrates, similar to Parthenium argentatum was performed using the washed rubber particles of Hevea brasiliensis. From these studies a polypeptide of 94 kD has been tentatively identified to be the rubber transferase in Hevea brasiliensis. Rubber transferase activity in stem bark tissue of Parthenium argentatum increased several fold by exposure of the plants to low w inter temperatures. Sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that the washed rubber particles proteins were higher in cold induced plant than the plants that were not exposed to cold temperature... 0aRubber chemistry. 0aTransferases. 0aGuayule. 4aMajor plant physiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBenedict, C.

This system was used to obtain prompt gamma spectra from geologic materials. A series of exposures of the geologic materials and elemental standards was performed in the neutron beam emitted from Beam Port #1 at the NSC. All exposures were performed at the same reactor position and power level, but the length of the exposures was varied. The system was able to detect the presence of several elements in an interference free condition and also to identify selected elements in the geologic materials. Quantitative measures of these elements in the unknown materials were estimated from the response of the system to known quantities. For those elements for which no standard sample was exposed, a rough calculational estimate was made based on prompt gamma yield values per unit neutron exposure obtained from previous experimenters. Large diameter samples of geologic material were placed in the neutron beam and neutron transmission and scattering measurements made. The results of these transmission experiments and the elemental compositions determined by the prompt gamma system were combined to produce a value for the gross absorption cross section of the material. The values obtained for some samples were compared to values previously obtained by another method. 0aNeutron capture gamma ray spectroscopy. 0aDrill core analysis. 4aMajor nuclear engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aReuscher, Jon A.,edegree supervisor.1 aParrish, T.

They were employed in this study to minimize variation in samples due to factors other than composition and density. Food items which were purchased from a local retailer are referred to as 'real' foods. Data on Model Foods was used to determine effect of composition and density on thermal conductivity of foods and to develop thermal conductivity prediction models. Three sets of 'real' food data were used for testing the performance and validity of the proposed models. Variation in the composition and densities were examined over the following ranges: water content, 0% to 80%; protein content, 0% to 30%; carbohydrate content, 0% to 60%; fat content, 0% to 100%; and density, 0.849 g/cm^2 to 1.189 g/cm^2. Effects of water content, fat content and density on thermal conductivity of Model Foods were found to be highly significant (PR > F = 0.0001) while effects of protein and carbohydrate contents were non-significant (PR > F = 0.7543 and PR > F = 0.7445, respectively). Linear models of thermal conductivity as a function of composition and density inadequately explain thermal conductivity of Model Foods. Two relatively simple quadratic models, Model 5 and Model 6, were developed. Model 5 expresses thermal conductivity as a function of water content, water content squared, and density. Model 6 contains all terms in Model 5 and includes the first and second order terms of fat content. Both models did equally well in predicting thermal conductivity of 'real' foods. However, Model 6 did better for high fat content foods. The performance of both models in prediction of thermal conductivity of 'real' foods is comparable to their performance with the Model Foods. Both proposed models were compared with two literature models which express thermal conductivity as a function of composition. The proposed model did equally well or better in predicting thermal conductivity of 'real' foods. The presence of density terms in Model 5 and Model 6 enables the models to predict thermal conductivity of unusually high or low density foods with smaller errors than that of literature models. 0aFoodxThermal properties. 0aHeatxConduction. 0aFoodxAnalysis. 4aMajor food science and technology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aSweat, Vincent E.,edegree supervisor.1 aDill, Charles W.,edegree committee member.1 aGarcia, Albert,edegree committee member.1 aJenkins, Omer C.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910699641xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1120392zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745089821&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsca9c2b65-7770-3be1-ba4c-4e78a8d7c9d6i8e652397-809e-3232-bc18-07b47052097d02827ctm a2200445Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004400109035002000153049000900173099003000182100002500212245010500237264001000342300004800352336002600400337002800426338002700454500002800481502004100509500001000550504004100560500003200601520105900633650003601692650003601728650002101764655002701785700004401812700004401856700005101900700004701951710005801998856007802056856015602134994001202290999007902302in0000117294920200904152627.0940119s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm29648348  9AGE5976AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)29648348  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaL52551 aLei, Junting,d1958-10aSynthesis and characterization of conductive polypyrrole - fibrils, composites, films, and powders / 1c1992.  axviii, 293 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The PPys obtained by these methods were characterized by spectroscopic and physical techniques. A variety of spectroscopic techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and 13C solid state NMR were used to study the chemical structure of the polymer obtained under different synthesis conditions. Physical techniques include the measurements of conductivity and densities of the polymer. Particularly important achievements in this study include the development of new methods for synthesis of PPy fibrils and composites, the novelty in experimental design for studying the properties of pristine PPy films, and detailed characterization of PPy fibrils, films, and powders. 0aConducting polymersxSynthesis. 0aConducting polymersxStructure. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMartin, Charles R.,edegree supervisor.1 aSoriaga, Manuel P.,edegree supervisor.1 aAppleby, Anthony J.,edegree committee member.1 aRowe, Marvin W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1365901zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744912971&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsa05e1981-7b0b-3e05-86dc-50e6cc8ef924i8faee171-fd55-3125-9e4c-f291d9f97dbe04163ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099003200194100003400226245007500260264001000335300005800345336002600403337002800429338002700457500002800484502004100512500001000553504005600563500003500619520211400654650002402768650002402792650003002816650002402846655002702870700004202897700004702939700004702986700005003033700004803083710005803131856016903189856007603358856015603434994001203590999007903602in0000002406720190325090717.0880829s1987    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm18422143  9AAB8770AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCOdTXA  a(OCoLC)18422143  aTXAM  a1987aDisser-atationaM6351 aMignery, Gregory Alan,d1958-10aMolecular characterization of the patatin multigene family of potato / 1c1987.  axi, 84 leaves :billustrations (some folded) ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

From this library, two groups of clones for the major tuber protein, patatin, were isolated. The complete sequence of two of these clones, pGM01 and pGM203, was determined. They are 98% homologous and correspond to the two major species of patatin identified by amino-terminal polypeptide sequence analysis. Both encode proteins of 363 amino acids with an additional 23 amino acid signal sequence. Patatin mRNA is approximately 1550 nucleotides in length and is present in large amounts in tubers, in trace amounts in roots, but is not present in leaves or stems. Potato DNA was used to construct genomic libraries from which 30 patatin genomic clones were isolated. All of these exhibited different restriction patterns, but could be divided into two classes based on the presence (Class II) or absence (Class I) of a 22 bp sequence within the 5'untranslated region. The complete DNA sequence of the Class I clone, PS20, the Class II clones SA10C and SB6B, and the 5' flanking sequence of seven additional clones was determined. The transcribed region of PS20 spans 3197 bp and is divided by six introns. The seven exons encode a transcript which is identical to the cDNA, pGM203. SB6B and SA10C both are pseudogenes which contain frameshift mutations. The 5' flanking sequences of both Class I and II patatin genes are highly homologous to position -87 and then diverge. This conserved region contains the CAAT and TATA homologies as well as a homology to the core enhancer sequence. Within a class there are additional large regions of homology, but differences exist that allow the patatin genes to be further divided into several discrete subclasses. S1 nuclease protection experiments with both Class I and Class II probes has shown that Class I transcripts are the predominant species present in tubers. Class II transcripts are present in tubers, but are 50-100 fold less abundant. In roots, Class II transcripts are the predominant species and there are few, if any, Class I transcripts. 0aMolecular genetics. 0aPotatoesxGenetics. 0aPlant molecular genetics. 4aMajor biochemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPark, William D.,edegree supervisor.1 aGunn, J.

Until recently such canopies have not been recognized in nature and the distribution of shallow salt beneath the lower continental slope of the northwest Gulf of Mexico has not been known. This study is the first publicly available field confirmation of a very extensive shallow salt canopy in the Gulf of Mexico region. Approximately 6,400 kilometers of 24- and 48-fold common depth point seismic data were interpreted in the region bounded by 94-96° west longitude and 26-27° north latitude. Maps of the seafloor morphology, the structure contour of the top of the allochthonous salt canopy, and the thickness of the suprasalt sediments show that almost the entire lower slope is covered by a shallow canopy. The broad area of little relief on the western side of Alaminos Canyon in underlain by salt and is not salt-free as previously proposed. Both Alaminos and Rio Perdido Canyons are salt-free areas between lobes of the distal front of the salt sheet. The canopy on the west side of the study area is classified as a stock canopy which formed when salt was pushed upward into sediments which have a lower density than salt. Gravitational spreading into low strength sediments formed a canopy in which the stock locations are marked by highs on the top of the salt sheet and/or by bathymetric highs. The salt spread out and downslope from these local highs in a more or less radial fashion and coalesced to form a large stock canopy. The canopy on the east side of the study area is classified as a lobe canopy which formed by downslope spreading from salt stocks; several lobes coalesced into a lobe canopy. Fluid pressure calculations reveal that the salt beneath seafloor uplifts is deeply rooted (7-15 km thick). Exploration strategy would center on the location of deep salt conduits and reservoirs beneath the canopy close to the intersection of the canopy and the deep stocks. 0aSaltzMexico, Gulf ofxMathematical models. 0aOcean bottomxPhysiological aspects. 0aOceanographyxResearch. 0aOcean bottomxMorphology. 4aMajor oceanography. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBryant, William R.,edegree supervisor.1 aCarter, Neville L.,edegree committee member.1 aFahlquist, Davis A.,edegree committee member.1 aGartner, Stefan,edegree committee member.1 aNelson, Thomas H.,edegree committee member.1 aRezak, Richard,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:901551141xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1117124zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746088571&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs4694e327-b80c-3e10-a011-3322bb4f1861i90568ff5-2221-34dc-bdb4-aa63fb992e6c03719ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100002800223245007600251264001000327300004700337336002600384337002800410338002700438500002800465502004100493500001000534504004100544500004500585520173400630650003002364650003902394650002102433650003402454655002702488700003802515700005102553700004402604700004902648710005802697856016902755856007802924856015603002994001203158999007903170in0000100872220200904152535.0910516s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23750416  9AFD6214AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23750416  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaT1641 aTang, Tian-Shen,d1957-10aOptimal control of a class of nonlinear distributed parameter systems / 1c1990.  axiii, 180 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

System analysis and control design are carried out based on the complete PDE model. The resulting infinite-dimensional optimal control is used as a reference to facilitate implementable finite-dimensional control. Toward the practical applications, we have introduced a new definition of admissible control, derived an integral version of maximum principle using dynamic programming and Sobolev space Frechet differential theory, and presented the costate equation in a general tensor notation. As special cases, we have studied the optimal control and optimal state estimation problems for quantum mechanical systems. We have studied the optimal regulation problem for a two-dimensional hyperbolic system. A general structure for the feedback control has been found. It has been shown that the linear component (in terms of system state) of the optimal feedback control is equal to the solution of the LQ problem for the linearized system. We have developed a target approximation method to facilitate a low dimension controller. This method uses a robust infinite dimensional closed-loop system as a reference, if designs a feedback controller and the actuator and sensor locations in such a way that the resulting feedback system imitates the target so that the closed-loop stability and design performance are preserved. We have studied in detail a nonlinear string vibration suppression problem. All the control design techniques developed in this dissertation are demonstrated on this example. 0aNonlinear control theory. 0aDifferential equations, Nonlinear. 0aSystem analysis. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHuang, G.

The trans-(Ph2PCH2CH2S)2Ni complex was obtained by reaction of PPh2CH2CH2SH with Ni(acac)2 or Ni(COD)2. The reactivity of (Ph2PCH2CH2S)2Ni with organic or inorganic electrophiles was dominated by sulfur sites; for example, reaction with CH3I and BrCH2CH2CH2Br afford cationic thioethers, reaction with SO2 resulted in the formation of an SO2 adduct, and reaction with (NBD)Mo(CO)4 yielded the bimetallic NiP2S2Mo(CO)4. Nickel thioether complexes, [Ni(PSEt)2][BF4]2 and [Ni(PSSP)][BF4]2, showed two reduction waves ascribed to Ni[^II/I] and Ni[^1/0]. Ni^0 species can be prepared by chemical reduction with Na/Hg, which provided synthetic route to the desired organometallic complexes of the type [Ni(PSR)2L]+ with L = H, CH3, COCH3 . Acetyl products were produced either from oxidative addition of CH3COCI to Ni^0 or by CO insertion into Ni-CH3 at low temperature. The reversible CO insertion has been found in the reaction of CO with Ni-CH3 derivatives. The reaction of (Ph2PCH2CH2S)2Ni with Fe2(CO)9 at 70 °C resulted in ligand transfer and the isolation of an Fe2S2 complex which was characterized by x-ray crystallography. This complex displayed reactivity toward acid and afforded iron products with both terminal and bridged hydrides. Furthermore, chemical reduction of the Fe2S2 complex gave [Fe(CO)2 (PS)]2- and [Fe(CO)2(PS)]2[^2-] species, respectively. Several Ni/Fe complexes based on the N2S2Ni metalloligand, (bmedaco)Ni, have been synthesized. The tetrametallic [(bme-daco)NiFeCl2]2 has been characterized by x-ray crystallography. These Ni/Fe complexes may be useful for interpreting EXAFS and other spectroscopies data of enzymes. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDarensbourg, Marcetta Y.,edegree supervisor.1 aAkgerman, Aydin,edegree committee member.1 aFackler, John P.,edegree committee member.1 aFindahl, Paul A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941079741xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1527030zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745768841&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6fa626a2-851e-3d5b-813d-4ea58969115di93b19deb-d4de-3b3c-91aa-499812d2660604251ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100002500223245009700248264001000345300002800355336002600383337002800409338002700437500002800464502004100492500001000533504004100543500004400584520228100628650001902909650004302928650002602971650003302997655002703030700003803057700004603095700004603141700004203187710005803229856016903287856007803456856015603534994001203690999007903702in0000100872120200904152532.0910516s1990    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23750372  9AFD6213AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23750372  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS3591 aSchneider, Steven C.14aThe relation of parenting styles and family environmental components to school performance / 1c1990.  aix, 124 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The ten components descriptive of family environment were cohesion, expressiveness, conflict, independence, achievement orientation, intellectual-cultural orientation, active-recreational orientation, moral religious emphasis, organization, and control. Parenting style variables evident in the home were classified as authoritarian, authoritative, or permissive. School outcome variables measured were grade point average, absences, conflicts with authority, and achievement. The subjects for the study were 207 adolescents from grades 9 through 12, randomly selected from a high school population of 1300. Subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire dealing with their situation at home and at school as it currently existed. The survey called for responses to demographic information, to a set of questions used to classify the style of parenting used in their home, and to the Family Environment Scale which is a measure of quality of family of origin environment. The results of the study supported the existence of a concomitant relationship between family environment and school outcome variables. Grade point average was significantly related to independence, achievement orientation, and intellectual-cultural orientation; attendance was significantly related to achievement orientation; and conflict at school was significantly related to the lack of moral-religious emphasis. With regard to predicting grade point average, achievement orientation in the home was most predictive of the ten environmental components. However, the ability of family environmental factors to predict attendance pattern, school conflict, or academic achievement was not shown to be significant. Finally, in terms of the ability of parenting style to predict school outcomes, authoritarian parenting was shown to be predictive of grade point average; authoritative and permissive parenting styles were shown to be predictive of attendance patterns; but, none of the parenting styles were shown to be significant predictors of either conflicts with authority or achievement. 0aChild rearing. 0aAchievement motivation in adolescence. 0aAcademic achievement. 4aMajor counseling psychology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHope, Lannes,edegree supervisor.1 aBarker, Donald,edegree committee member.1 aDuffy, Michael,edegree committee member.1 aSell, Jane,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910698541xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1163152zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746142071&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsdaa6c758-a5e4-3ef0-be0a-3f5a2474efd7i93b59116-8c95-3a68-8f07-aefabdb380dc03000ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006500109024001700174035002000191049000900211099002900220100004100249245010300290264001000393300004500403336002600448337002800474338002700502500002800529502004100557500001000598504004100608500003200649520106700681650004401748650004101792650003501833650002801868650002101896655002701917700004101944700005201985700004802037700005002085710005802135856007802193856015602271994001202427999007902439in0000112197220200904152549.0930127s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27327535  9AFV8252AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdGBVCPdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA8 aZBWT00494624  a(OCoLC)27327535  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaG4791 aGillette, Belinda Ann Brewer,d1957-10aRational expectations equilibrium in a market with restricted access to differential information / 1c1991.  aix, 109 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Access to the first information source is institutionally limited to a fixed proportion of traders, insiders, while information on the second source is available to all traders, including the insiders, at the same cost. An interior equilibrium exists where a fraction of inside traders acquire outside information and some outside traders remain uninformed. Small parameter changes can shift the equilibrium from an interior to a corner, leading to discontinuity in the equilibrium information allocation and other endogenous variables. The highly nonlinear nature of the rational expectations equilibrium price and informational conditions makes comparative statistics analytically impossible. Among the main results of an extensive numerical analysis, the equilibrium information allocation responds asymmetrically to increases and decreases in the uncertainty of the risky asset return and in the uncertainty of the risky supply. 0aRational expectations (Economic theory) 0aCapital marketxMathematical models. 0aInsider trading in securities. 0aEquilibrium (Economics) 4aMajor economics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHwang, Hae-Shin,edegree supervisor.1 aBattalio, Raymond C.,edegree committee member.1 aBaye, Michael R.,edegree committee member.1 aDubofsky, David A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1284229zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744858331&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs0871fa23-815a-3317-83fa-08ce9d28ef90i953bdc1b-e18a-3a18-a276-b40b856e9bb003765ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002700197245009400224264001000318300004600328336002600374337002800400338002700428504004100455500001000496502004100506500004500547520213000592650003402722655002702756700004402783700004602827700005102873700004802924710005802972856007803030856015603108994001203264999007903276in0000126841520200904152723.0960308s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34334207  9AGX0594AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34334207  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaS5921 aSimmons, Rodney James.10aValidation of a technique for the assessment of occupational exposure to methanol vapor / 1c1993.  axii, 288 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

This air sampling technique utilized carbon molecular sieve contained in a stainless steel tube for the collection of methanol vapor from controlled test atmospheres. The test atmospheres were generated by means of a dynamic, all-glass system which utilized a syringe drive to introduce methanol into an air stream of known temperature and humidity. The sampling period for all samples was 120 minutes. The test atmosphere was drawn through the tube by means of a battery-powered air sampling pump which could be fitted with various flow-limiting orifices. In preliminary studies at test conditions of 95% RH at 35° C, and 400 ppm methanol, a sampling flow rate of 20 mL/min (established by means of limiting orifices) was the maximum flow which did not produce more than 5% breakthrough; this sampling flow rate was used in all subsequent parts of the research. The collection tubes were desorbed with 250° C nitrogen in a programmed thermal desorber, and the amount of desorbed methanol vapor was determined through gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. The analytical instrumentation was calibrated by direct injection of methanol into the inlet of the programmed thermal desorber. Next studies were conducted to assess the performance of the technique under conditions of varying temperature, humidity, and methanol concentration. These investigations demonstrated that the methanol concentration, partial pressure of water vapor, and the interaction of temperature with partial pressure of water vapor had a significant effect upon the recovery, while breakthrough was significantly affected by the partial pressure of water vapor and the interaction of temperature with the partial pressure of water vapor. In general, the data suggest that the sampling flow rate should be increased to 50-100 mL/min if the anticipated methanol concentration is less than 50 ppm and that breakthrough occurred only under conditions of high heat and humidity when the methanol concentration was 800 ppm... 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKonzen, Richard B.,edegree supervisor.1 aFox, Milden J.,edegree committee member.1 aJohnston, Waymon L.,edegree committee member.1 aRussell, Leon H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1520699zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745226541&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsb06cf5a4-4d2a-3f7c-a8e9-2ddd05d8fbc8i95428c0e-04b5-31b1-b53a-a7bbc83b95ad03681ctm a2200433Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100003200209245008400241264001000325300002800335336002600363337002800389338002700417504004100444500001000485502004100495500003700536520184600573650002602419655002702445700003902472700004702511700004302558700004602601700004802647710005802695856016902753856007802922856015603000994001203156999007903168in0000127279320200904152722.0960411s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34551722  9AGY1256AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34551722  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaS4751 aSenechal, Neil Paul,d1965-10aInheritance of somatic embryogenesis in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) / 1c1993.  avii, 58 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Somatic embryogenesis is important because it is essential for the regeneration of intact plants from transgenic cell. Somatic embryogenesis has been suspected for some time to be genotype dependant, but the mode of inheritance and the number of genes affecting the trait were unknown. In this research, crosses were made between four cotton genotypes; Coker 312, and TM-1, 'Stoneville 506' or 'Acala SJ-2'. Parents and their progenies were tested in tissue culture for somatic embryogenic potential. A complete randomized block design was used for tissue culture research, and calli were initiated from hypocotyl tissue of three to five day old seedlings. Globular embryos were present in calli after six weeks in culture, but many embryos could not be differentiated at that time. The embryos were transferred to culture flasks with liquid media until four weeks later, at which time they were scored. There was no evidence of maternal effects on somatic embryogenesis. Chi-square tests were used to test ratios corresponding to possible genetic systems for the embryogenic trait. Embryogenesis in Coker 312 was found to be controlled by one dominant gene. The expression of that dominant gene for embryogenesis is blocked by two or three dominant genes at separate loci in TM-1, Stoneville 506, and Acala SJ-2. Breeding for embryogenic potential in cotton is feasible, and would be best accomplished by a cycle of repeated backcrossing, selfing, and selection with Coker 312 as the donor parent. Large populations would be needed in the backcross generations of such a selection program because of the low frequency of embryogenic plants resulting from backcrossing. 4aMajor plant breeding. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aEl-Zik, K.

Resistant horn flies were less fit than susceptible flies. Pyrethroid-resistance was a reproductive disadvantage under insecticide free conditions. This disadvantage may be integrated into a horn fly control program. A field technique was developed to monitor insecticide-resistance in horn flies. The technique quickly and successfully determined the amount of resistance present in various populations by using discriminating doses of insecticides. This technique is easier to use and simpler to prepare than current techniques. In vitro saxitoxin (STX) binding to proteins from the heads of susceptible and target-site insensitive house flies, Musca domestica L., and horn flies was measured. STX bound to a single type of high affinity site in house fly heads that had not been exposed to any insecticides. STX binding to horn fly heads was low and difficult to measure, but appeared to occur similarly to the mechanism in house flies. In vivo insecticide exposure rapidly (15 minutes) reduced STX binding to house fly heads and indicated that binding sites were associated with either two types of sodium channels, or two types of regulation, or both. Exposure to permethrin reduced binding to one type of site more than to the other. Exposure to cypermethrin or diazinon reduced binding to both sites equally. This work is the first report on the effects of in vivo insecticide exposure on STX binding to sodium channels in an insect. Susceptible and resistant house flies had similar amounts of sodium channel protein. In resistant flies, the ratio of the two types of binding sites differed from that of susceptible files. Only resistant flies showed behavioral and biochemical signs of recovery from intoxication by pyrethroids. Lipid extractions from heads of susceptible and target-site insensitive house flies indicated that both strains had similar amounts of lipids. Pyrethroid exposure, did not alter the turnover of lipids.

The error component model is the most popular specification in panel data econometrics. With panel data, we can answer more complex questions than would be possible by using time-series data or cross-sectional data alone. However, panel data also introduce difficulties. For the one-way error component model, if the error term is serially correlated, then the estimation methods were quite complicated. This dissertation proposes a simple transformation that circumvents the problem of serial correlation in an error component model. This not only simplifies the calculation, but also gives natural estimators of the variance components. Moreover, we generalize Breusch's (1987) maximum likelihood estimation method to the serial correlation case. Which can be used to guard against possible local maxima. We also derive the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) for the error component model with an arbitrary serially correlated remainder term. We show that once one knows the BLUP for the time series model with serially correlated errors, using our method, one can immediately write out the corresponding BLUP for error component model with the same type of serial correlation in the remainder term. Thus our approach makes the panel data literature parallel to that of time series literature and therefore should prove very useful in applications. The chapter of testing serial correlation gives several Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests for testing first-order serial correlation. Our Monte Carlo results show that these tests perform well in detecting serial correlation in an error component model. We also show that the LM test cannot distinguish a first order autocorrelation (AR(1)) process from a first order moving average (MA(1)) process. Thus we further derive several tests for testing AR(1) against MA(1) in an error component model. Another problem with the error component model is that the commonly used test statistic for testing zero variance component is the two-sided Breusch-Pagan test. However, since the variance component never takes negative values, the proper test statistic should be one-sided. Although Honda (1985) and King and Wu (1990) derived some one-sided test statistics for the error component model. We show that these tests have some drawbacks, we further derive some new tests which are immune to these drawbacks. Our Monte Carlo results show that these new tests perform better than the existing tests. 0aEconometrics. 0aError analysis (Mathematics) 0aPanel analysis. 4aMajor economics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBaltagi, Badi H.,edegree supervisor.1 aHwang, Hae-shin,edegree committee member.1 aTian, Guoqiang,edegree committee member.1 aZhou, Jianxin,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1250376zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744858361&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs9ae7c614-b2b0-39f1-889e-b7a2f112baf9i97029475-53c2-3ae0-a48f-33bac2134d8903068ctm a2200445Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002400218245005500242264001000297300004600307336002600353337002800379338002700407500002800434502004100462500001000503504004100513500004500554520135000599650002601949650002501975650003402000655002702034700004202061700004702103700004602150700004302196710005802239856007802297856015602375994001202531999007902543in0000111668720200904152609.0930225s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27575926  9AFV4779AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27575926  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaY9351 aYuan, Ruixi,d1965-10aQuantum amplifier model for semiconductor lasers / 1c1991.  axii, 120 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This model is capable of predicting the temporal variations of optical output power from semiconductor lasers on a picosecond time scale. For the first time, the polarization dynamics of lasing medium is taken into account by introducing the modified rate equations. It has also included the longitudinal nonuniformity of the laser parameters, together with the quantum noise of laser diode through the propagating photon packet approach. Semiconductor laser characteristics under various operating conditions are investigated systematically. It is found that the finite lasing medium response delay plays an important role in the laser operation, and the correction to the conventional rate equations approach can be substantial when quantum noise is included or when the laser diode is under high speed modulation. Quantitative results for the noise characteristics pertinent to some application systems are obtained using a Monte-Carlo method. Numerical simulation demonstrates that amplified quantum fluctuations can serve as a mechanism for inducing stochastic modelocking in semi; conductor lasers. The feasibility of using optimized active modelocking configuration to generate ultrashort optical pulses without large satelite pulses is also discussed. 0aSemiconductor lasers. 0aQuantum electronics. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aTaylor, Henry F.,edegree supervisor.1 aChan, Andrew K.,edegree committee member.1 aFry, Edward S.,edegree committee member.1 aSu, Chin B.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1281133zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746228311&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs0b0d40b4-0f47-3acd-9d6b-022d86421735i9741f375-c113-3660-8655-65668300d4b504217ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005800109035002000167049000900187099002900196100003700225245014500262264001000407300004400417336002600461337002800487338002700515504004100542500001000583502004100593500004600634520229100680650005102971650002103022650003603043650003503079655002703114700004203141700005003183700004803233700004603281700004903327710005803376856007803434856015603512994001203668999007903680in0000120299620200904152639.0941031s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31384080  9AGM7661AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)31384080  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaT2751 aTellez Isaias, Guillermo,d1963-10aEndogenous factors and mechanisms that confer resistance to Salmonella enteritidis infectivity in the intestinal tract of Leghorn chickens / 1c1992.  ax, 112 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

In both trials, the observed lactose-induced resistance to SE organ invasion following 14 days (P < 0.001) or 19 days (P < 0.005) was associated not only which an increase in organic acid concentration and acidic cecal pH (P < 0.05), but with measurable morphologic changes of the cecal mucosa as well (P < 0.05). (B) The effects of 14 or 19 days of 18 ppm dietary capsaicin administration on SE infection, and histological, morphometric and pH changes of the ceca. In both trials, the observed capsaicin-induced resistance to SE organ invasion (P < 0.05) was associated with measurable pH and morphometric changes of the cecal mucosa (P < 0.05) due to the presence of inflammatory cells in lamina propria. (C) The effect of prophylactic treatment of chickens with the soluble products from Con A-stimulated SE-immune T-cells on SE infection, histological and morphometric changes. In these experiments, the resistance to SE organ infectivity was associated with a significant increase in lamina propria thickness based on morphometric analysis (P < 0.05). This increase appears to be due to a marked infiltration of inflammatory cells, indicating that the protective effect of prophylactic administration of lymphokines, prepared from Con A-activated SE-immune T-cells, against a challenge infection with SE is associated with measurable and morphometric changes of the cecal mucosa. (D) Comparable measurable and morphometric changes were associated with the significant decrease in SE organ infectivity (P < 0.05) following the administration of either low doses of Eimeria tenella (ET) or high doses of the heterologous Eimeria adenoeides (EA). In both trials, a significant correlation, (r = -0.98) for ET or (r = -0.99) for EA, between organ invasion and lamina propria thickness was observed, suggesting that the thicker the lamina propria is, due to the presence of inflammatory cells, the less SE organ invasion occurs. 0aSalmonella enteritidisxImmunological aspects. 0aLeghorn chicken. 0aChickensxDiseasesxPrevention. 4aMajor veterinary microbiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHargis, Billy M.,edegree supervisor.1 aCorrier, Donald E.,edegree committee member.1 aDeLoach, John R.,edegree committee member.1 aJaeger, Laurie,edegree committee member.1 aKogut, Michael H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1433839zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746517411&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsbc5ea2c5-712e-3bce-a380-e8965151f650i97aa776a-ac2a-3fd7-8827-db2b934fbbbb03904ctm a2200493Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040007000109035002000179050002100199049000900220099002800229100002800257245007200285264001000357300004400367336002600411337002800437338002700465500002800492502004100520500001000561504004100571500003000612520185300642650001802495650002002513650002902533650001902562655002702581700005102608700004902659700004802708700005202756700005002808710005802858856016902916856007803085856015603163994001203319999007903331in0000099747420200904152538.0910329s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23354507  9AEZ1745AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUSACEdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)2335450714aTC175b.Z43 1990  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaZ631 aZhang, Manjiang,d1941-10aPrediction of bank erosion for alluvial channels below reservoirs / 1c1990.  ax, 190 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The sediment-free water released from the reservoir could induce severe problems on downstream channel erosion because the reservoir trapping sediment load disturbs the natural balance between sediment supply and sediment transport. To satisfy its transport capacity, the flow scours the channel and picks up sediment load. The reservoir-induced erosion superimposes on the natural erosion process and will continue until a new equilibrium is reached. The erosion rate induced by an upstream reservoir is estimated by an erosion-rate model proposed in this study. The parameters in this model are defined by algebraic relations in terms of channel characteristics. These relations are derived from regression analyses based on the data published by Williams and Wolman (1984). These empirical relations can be used to determine the unknown parameters for a given stream by input of the channel slope, flow discharge and velocity. The validity of the proposed model is tested by the published field data, and the stream bank erosion of a meander bend in a natural state is estimated by using Odgaard's (1987) Equation, which expresses bank erosion in terms of channel characteristics. Bank erosion below a reservoir is the result of natural erosion and reservoir-induced erosion. The computation of estimation is facilitated by a computer program. EROS.FOR. which is written in FORTRAN. This method is illustrated by examples of the Colorado River and Brazos River, both in Texas. Com paring the estimated data with the observed data on these rivers shows that the method provides reasonable and acceptable estimates for bank erosion of alluvial channels below reservoirs. The method is easy to use and is valid for gross planning purposes. 0aSoil erosion. 0aRiver channels. 0aReservoir sedimentation. 4aMajor geology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMathewson, Christopher C.,edegree supervisor.1 aGiardino, J.

However, a major drawback of such systems is that a single processor failure may destroy the whole network.  As the probability of any one or more processors failing in such a complex system is great, building some fault-tolerance feature into them becomes extremely important.  In this dissertation, a new effective approach is proposed for achieving fault tolerance in hypercubes.  This approach will enable the hypercube to continue working in case of failure in a short time. In particular, three algorithms are presented for reconfiguring faulty hypercubes using spanning trees to achieve communication between the unfaulty processors.  The first algorithm uses the completely unbalanced spanning tree (CUST), the second one uses the balanced spanning tree (BST), and the third algorithm is based on using general spanning trees (GST) for reconfiguring the hypercube to avoid faulty nodes.  The parallel algorithm developed for reconfiguring faulty hypercubes using GST can be generalized to work for reconfiguring multicomputer networks in general in the presence of faults.  These algorithms use, at most, one used link and one unused link for every reconstructed path in the reconfigured hypercube.  These reconstruction algorithms can reconfigure around any single fault in 0(l) reconfiguration time with no extra-dilation and will increase the congestion of a link by, at most, one.  The algorithms are optimal, in terms of the reconfiguration time, and can be used for reconfiguration of spanning trees, which have been used extensively for communications and broadcasting, in a hypercube in the presence of node failures. Simulation results for the algorithms under multiple faults also are presented.  Results show that the algorithms provide close to 100% fault coverage of double and triple faults for hypercubes having a dimension of 10 or more.  Fault coverage and congestion results for up to 60 faults having different cube sizes are presented.  We also evaluate the improvement of reliability in hypercubes based on these reconfiguration algorithms.  With these algorithms, the system's recovery is shown to be faster, improving hypercube reliability.  A dependability evaluation study, based on a Markov chain model for a cluster of four hypercube nodes, is presented. 4aMajor computer science.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741964801&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aMARSffs29a11855-5334-3505-ac35-91cf08a9b543i982407e1-a8a0-3855-9c24-36572349f06e04186ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100003400197245012700231264001000358300002600368336002600394337002800420338002700448504004100475500001000516502004100526500004500567520238500612650003402997655002703031700004503058700004603103700004903149700005003198710005803248856015603306856007803462856013303540994001203673999007903685in0000129948320200904152731.0960605s1994    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34872574  9AHA6258AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34872574  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaK4571 aKhee Guan, Andrew Tan,d1966-10aMonte Carlo evidence on consumer surplus estimation using parametric and semiparametric models /cby Andrew Tan Khee Guan. 1c1994.  ax, 79 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The experiments are designed to simulate censored and truncated recreation demand data under different error distributions, sample sizes, and censorship rates. Within each experiment, consumer surplus is estimated using observed and predicted demand. Summary statistics are used to determine the direction and magnitude of the error introduced into consumer surplus due to model misspecification, and to examine the robustness of fconsumer surplus derived from semiparametric models. Various implications are clearly evident from the Monte Carlo experiments using Tobit models. First, non-normality (in general) leads to overestimation of consumer surplus when using either observed or predicted demand. Second, heteroscedasticity leads to 20% overestimation of consumer surplus when using predicted demand, but only leads to 3% overestimation when using observed demand. The overall implication of these results stresses the importance of testing for model misspecification when using the Tobit model to estimate consumer surplus. If misspecification is present, researchers need to correct for it in order to arrive at accurate and reliable consumer surplus estimates. Otherwise, the use of a semiparateric model is a viable alternative. Various results are also evident for the Monte Carlo experiments using semiparametric models. First, consumer surplus derived from the symmetrically trimmed least squares model tends to overestimate the simulated consumer surplus in all cases except for two sample designs. Second, consumer surplus computed from the Buckley and James model are nearly identical to the simulated consumer surplus in all cases. The overall implication of this finding supports the use of the Buckley and James model to compute consumer surplus.  Finally, results from the Monte Carlo experiments using truncated parametric and semiparametric models are very pessimistic. The results indicate that consumer surplus derived from truncated parametric and semiparametric models tend to greatly overestimate the simulated consumer surplus (i.e., by greater than 70%). The implications of this finding are that researchers either need to cease using on-site sample surveys to estimate consumer surplus, or develop alternative truncated models. 4aMajor agricultural economics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aOzuna, Jr., Teofilo,edegree supervisor.1 aBoadu, Fred O.,edegree committee member.1 aKnight, Thomas O.,edegree committee member.1 aNeilson, Wiliam S.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741279261&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OakTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554798zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741279261&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffsf37ea74b-752e-39eb-bd9b-4b6e40309d75i98c84554-9e05-3f5a-b281-c55fe3a7347a03085ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099003200180100003100212245014500243264001000388300004600398336002600444337002800470338002700498500002800525502004100553500001000594504004100604500003500645520101500680650004401695650006101739650002401800650002401824655002701848700004201875700004701917700004801964700005202012710005802064856016902122856007702291856015602368994001202524999007902536in0000077638220200904152429.0891003s1988    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm20432097  9ADM5201AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)20432097  aTXAM  a1988aDisser-atationaP6181 aPierce, Vicki Joan,d1955-12aA screening technique for detecting levels of resistance in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) to belly rot induced by Rhizoctonia solani Kuehn / 1c1988.  aviii, 69 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Inoculum in an unsterilized soil, naturally infested with Rhizoctonia solani Kuehn, AG-4, was increased by placing whole cucumber fruit in contact with the moistened soil until the fruit rotted. The screening technique required a uniformly controlled soil environment, with an inoculum density of 30 propagules/100 gm soil, a temperature of 30°C, and 12% moisture. Fruit to be screened were placed on the prepared soil and a PVC film cover maintained soil moisture during the three day screening. Soil depth, ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 cm in the screening chamber, did not affect infection nor did disturbing the fruit daily during screening. Attached fruit were shown to be more susceptible to belly rot than detached fruit, and fruit grown on turgid plants were more susceptible than fruit which had developed on wilted plants. Genetic resistance was correlated with tough skin in some breeding lines. 0aCucumbersxDisease and pest resistance. 0aCucumbersxDisease and pest resistancexGenetic aspects. 0aRhizoctonia solani. 4aMajor horticulture. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPike, Leonard M.,edegree supervisor.1 aBird, Luther S.,edegree committee member.1 aGoods, Monroe J.,edegree committee member.1 aMiller, J.

This study provides a comparison of two theoretical methods, Aaron and McGuire's marginal valuation and Brennan's uniform pricing valuation of public good benefits. The comparison is based on the principle that income is to be taken as the best available indicator of individual welfare. This study shows that the marginal valuation procedure is more restrictive than the uniform pricing valuation procedure as a welfare index of consumption bundles. 0aPublic goods. 0aIncome distribution. 0aWelfare economics. 4aÖffentliches GutxEinkommensverteilungxTheorie. 4aMajor economics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBrowning, Edgar K.,edegree supervisor.1 aAlderson, Michael J.,edegree committee member.1 aGronberg, Timothy J.,edegree committee member.1 aReynolds, Morgan O.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911833641xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1174771zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746143271&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs9a961786-6d2c-3d4d-9ddf-0b3d9c46f32fi9951fd33-6872-3f40-a7ba-3d524cfdd27c03031ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100002500217245007000242264001000312300004600322336002600368337002800394338002700422500002800449502004100477500001000518504004100528500003000569520125500599650005201854650002101906650001901927650001901946655002701965700004301992700005002035700005102085700005402136710005802190856007802248856015602326994001202482999007902494in0000112814020200904152626.0930409s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27881680  9AFW7779AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27881680  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaK231 aKazimi, Reza,d1961-10aDesign, construction, and test of a 473 MHZ four-rod cavity RFQ / 1c1992.  axiii, 98 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The RFQ is designed to accelerate a 10 mA H- ion beam from 30 keV to 500 keV with the operating frequency of 473 MHz. This new type of RFQ structure not only promises simplicity of design, construction, and operation, but also can be manufactured to operate at higher frequencies than previously achieved by other four-rod type RFQs. Combination of simplicity and compactness due to higher operating frequencies (400 to 500 MHz) makes the design desirable for injector of proton accelerators, medical linear accelerators, and variety of other applications. This dissertation presents the steps I went through in inventing, developing, and experimentally testing this new RFQ design. First an introduction to accelerators is given, and the basic accelerator physics terminologies are defined. The principles of operations of the RFQs are described, and the theory behind new type of RFQ structure is explained. Then the beam dynamics and cavity design of the RFQ are presented. Finally, the mechanical design and construction procedure are discussed, and experimental results of rf tests and actual H- beam test are given. 0aParticle acceleratorsxDesign and construction. 0aRadio frequency. 0aBeam dynamics. 4aMajor physics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHuson, F.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that the Form 8-K which reports a change in auditors also indicate if the change is due to the resignation of the auditor. This action implies a belief by the SEC that an auditor resignation may communicate different information to the market than would the termination of an auditor by a client company. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the announcement of an auditor resignation has information content for the market. The reaction to the announcement is significantly negative on the day of the filing of the 8-K, the day following, and in the two-day window taken as a whole. Alternative explanations for the observed negative returns are explored and rejected. Results of an examination of a portfolio of companies failing to provide a reason and name a successor, and a portfolio of companies giving a reason for the auditor resignation or of giving information concerning the successor auditor reveal no significant differences between the returns of these portfolios. No difference is observed in the response of a portfolio of companies providing a reason for the resignation and a portfolio of those companies which fail to provide a reason. Tests are performed to test the sensitivity of the results to the deletion of outliers and the deletion of companies having firm-specific news announcements in the event window. It does not appear that extreme outliers or firm-specific new announcements are responsible for the negative returns exhibited in this sample of companies. The sensitivity of the results to day-of-the-week effects is tested and also rejected as a possible explanation for the negative returns observed in this sample. It appears that significant and persistent negative returns are earned by companies' shareholders when it is announced that auditors have resigned. 4aMajor accounting. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStrawser, Robert H.,edegree supervisor.1 aKerr, David S.,edegree committee member.1 aLoudder, Martha L.,edegree committee member.1 aMcWilliams, Abagail,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1521998zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744716331&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs977ffd50-8147-3680-a364-83b8565d336ai9b3aa459-aadf-32f3-bdbb-02f08410d27e03341ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003100218245005000249264001000299300004700309336002600356337002800382338002700410500002800437502004100465500001000506504004100516500003000557520157500587650002502162650002102187650001702208650001702225650001902242655002702261700004702288700005102335700004702386700005502433710005802488856007802546856015602624994001202780999007902792in0000111395320200904152601.0930121s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27299256  9AFV6391AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27299256  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaR3111 aRecord, Rae Denese,d1959-10aMembrane trafficking in soybean protoplasts / 1c1991.  axiii, 119 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The convergence of the endocytic pathway and the lysosomal and secretory pathways was examined by incubating protoplasts in an electron-dense, adsorptive-endocytosis marker, cationized ferritin (CF), and histochemically labeling for acid phosphatase (AcPase) activity. Both labels were ultrastructurally co-localized in endocytic vesicles, the Golgi apparatus, multivesicular bodies (MVB), and the large central vacuole. Protoplasts were also incubated in CF and immunolabeled for glucosidase II (GSII), a glycosylation-trimming enzyme. CF and GSII were co-localized along the plasma membrane, in endocytic vesicles, the partially-coated reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and MVB. The ability of cells to sort proteins and polysaccharides to the correct destination was investigated by incubating protoplasts in monensin, an ionophore, and CF and histochemically labeling for AcPase activity. Monensin inhibited the localization of AcPase in multivesicular bodies, indicating that there may be a monensin-sensitive sorting mechanism in plants Monensin did not inhibit the internalization of CF. Lucifer yellow (LY) internalization was examined for its usefulness as a fluid-phase marker. Monensin did not inhibit by internalization. Probenecid, an anion transport inhibitor, changed the localization of LY, suggesting that some BY is internalized by an anion transport mechanism. This would rule out LY as an appropriate fluid-phase marker in plant cells. 0aSoybeanxPhysiology. 0aPlant membranes. 0aProtoplasts. 0aEndocytosis. 4aMajor biology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGriffing, Lawrence R.,edegree supervisor.1 aMcKnight, Thomas D.,edegree committee member.1 aMullet, John E.,edegree committee member.1 aVandenBosch, Kathryn A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1282553zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746228111&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs99cba61c-5aef-3f67-8bc1-ae61a2a086a5i9c27cf99-3f27-39c6-b185-b0776e85af4003140ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172043001200192050002600204049000900230099002900239100002000268245008900288264001000377300005300387336002600440337002800466338002700494504004100521500001000562502004100572500003200613520108600645650003601731650004801767650001801815650001701833650002101850650005501871650006701926651003701993655002702030700004802057700004602105700004602151700004202197710005802239856007802297856015602375994001202531999007902543in0000126158720200904152705.0960227s1993    xx ab    bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34275047  9AGW8666AM  aTXAbengcTXAdTLSdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)34275047  an-us-tx 4aRA645.36.T4bG27 1993  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG2451 aGarza, Cecilia.10aAccess, distribution and equity of services in two Texas home health care programs / 1c1993.  axiii, 214 leaves :billustrations, maps ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Using descriptive, explanatory and interpretive modes of inquiry, this research seeks two major objectives: (1) to determine whether access to the two programs is equitable, and (2) to discover the existing structural patterns which create inequitable distribution of services. A theoretical model is proposed from a political economy perspective identifying the characteristics in the delivery of services which maximize utilization of services and those which detract from it. The findings indicate that in order to assess service utilization it is necessary to incorporate both client characteristics and societal influences. Multiple factors external to the individuals in need of services determine service utilization. Recommendations are included for redirecting a commitment of resources to reach and serve the needs of diverse populations with a continuum of options for long-term care services. 0aOlder peoplexHome carezTexas. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxHome carezTexas. 0aPrimary care. 0aFamily care. 4aMajor sociology. 7aOlder peoplexHome care.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01199110 7aPeople with disabilitiesxHome care.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01057287 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMcIntosh, William Alex,edegree supervisor.1 aDuffy, Michael,edegree committee member.1 aSaenz, Rogelio,edegree committee member.1 aSell, Jane,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1518979zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744716121&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsc921012f-2066-3ad8-a024-42ff7167acc9i9cc255c7-db7c-3e81-88db-1308304a3ecb04173ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002700209245009200236264001000328300004500338336002600383337002800409338002700437500002800464502004100492500001000533504004100543500003700584520220500621650003102826650003302857650003402890650002602924655002702950700003902977700004503016700004703061700004303108710005803151856016903209856007803378856015603456994001203612999007903624in0000100873620200904152524.0910516s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23752321  9AFD6228AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23752321  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaM1681 aMcMurry, Bryan,d1954-10aAssociation of sheath and navel score with growth and sale price in Beefmaster cattle / 1c1990.  avii, 54 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Statistical analysis was performed on these data to evaluate the effects of: year, herd, sire, sex of calf, season of birth and sex x season interaction on 205d, age of dam adjusted, weaning weight and calf sheath/navel score. Further analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of herd, sex of calf, dam navel score, sire sheath score, dam navel x sire sheath and adjusted weaning weight on calf sheath/navel score. The sale data was analyzed to evaluate the effects of sheath score on sale price. The effect of sires was nested within herd and herd was nested within year. The effects of herd, sire within herd and sex of calf were significant for adjusted weaning weight (P <.001). Bull calves were heavier at weaning than heifer calves. Calf sheath/navel score was significant for adjusted weaning weight (P <.05). Calves scoring three for sheath/navel were heavier than those scoring two or less, but were not different than calves scoring four or greater. The effects of herd, sex of calf, dam navel score, sire sheath score, dam navel x sire sheath interaction and adjusted weaning weight were significant for calf sheath/navel score. Bull calves had higher sheath/navel scores than heifer calves (P <.01). Calf sheath/navel score increased significantly with both dam navel score (P <.01) and sire sheath score (P <.001). The dam navel x sire sheath interaction was significant for calf sheath/navel score (P <.05). The magnitude of the differences in mean calf sheath/navel score for the three sire sheath scores are greater for dam navel scores two or less and four or greater than for dam navel score three. Adjusted weaning weight was also significant for calf sheath/navel score. Heavier calves tended to have higher sheath/navel scores (more pendulous) than lighter calves. The heritability estimate of calf sheath/navel score was.55 [plus or minus] .07. Both genetic and phenotypic correlations between calf sheath/navel score and adjusted weaning weight were near zero. Sheath score did not appear to have a significant effect on the sale price of Beefmaster bulls. 0aBeefmaster cattlexGrowth. 0aBeefmaster cattlexBreeding. 0aBeefmaster cattlexMarketing. 4aMajor animal science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aTurner, J.

This matrix is composed of a spherulitic superstructure with a lamellar microstructure. The careful study of characterized fractions allowed the quantitative description of the melting profile of the whole copolymer, which corresponds to the crystallite size distribution. This description was achieved by the calculation of the most probable unbranched ethylene sequence, and whereby it was assumed that the lamellar thickness is directly linked to this sequence. This lamellar thickness had to be adjusted by the number average molecular weight to achieve the final distribution. Another method extrapolated the effect of branching on this sequence from a region of low branching frequency to a region of high frequency. This lamellar thickness also had to be adjusted by the number average molecular weight to achieve the final distribution. The crystallite size distribution of the fractions and the whole copolymer was changed by annealing procedures. The rate of change was accelerated by the use of cool-raise and cool-raise-cool procedures. The rate and extent of change is governed by the branch and molecular weight distribution. The total crystallinity was rather invariant for this copolymer. This was explained by segregation of low-molecular weight fractions. At very low strain, the stress relaxation was found to be dependent on the total crystallinity, but independent of the crystallite size distribution. Frequency-temperature studies indicated that the modulus may be predicted, at least up to the melting point, by the extrapolation of low temperature data and by taking into account changes in the degree of crystallinity. However, the imaginary modulus is affected more than the real modulus by the distribution change. 0aPolyethylenexMechanical properties. 0aPolymersxAnalysis. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHoeve, C.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in this area due to the mounting U.S. trade deficits. Economists have found that when markets are imperfectly competitive, there are certain trade policies that can benefit a country at the expense of others. The choice of policy is thus viewed as a strategic game between governments. This game is complicated by the presence of uncertainty in the market. This dissertation analyzes a government's optimal choice of trade policy under a variety of market structures and assumptions concerning the structure of costs faced by firm s. In particular, governments are shown to prefer price-type policy instruments, namely subsidies or taxes, in a highly uncertain environment, and quantity controls if demand is reasonably stable. Furthermore, this pattern of preferences is shown to hold across a variety if cost structures and assumptions regarding firm behavior. 0aCommercial policy. 0aOligopolies. 0aForeign trade regulation. 4aMajor economics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHwang, Hae-Shin,edegree supervisor.1 aDeily, Mary E.,edegree committee member.1 aMaurice, S.

Stochasticity may be introduced into a compartment system in many ways. In some instances, the transition rate coefficient is random, either between replicates, or between particles within a replicate, introducing stochastic mixture models. The error structure for some one and two compartment mixture models is derived, based on the randomness of the transition rate. The effects of using the model variances derived in the estimation process are investigated. The effect of model misspecification in the parameter estimates is also investigated, using several data sets and simulations. 0aCompartmental analysis (Biology) 0aParameter estimation. 0aBiomathematics. 4aMajor statistics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMatis, James H.,edegree supervisor.1 aFolse, L.

The cross-reactive mabs were then tested for their ability to inhibit bovine fertilization in vitro.  Finally, functional studies were performed to determine how one of the mabs was affectin(Y fertilization.  The mabs chosen for this project were generated against the human sperm antigens FA-1, SAA-1, and SP- I 0. Western blot analysis revealed that the mabs identified antigens of similar molecular weight to human FA-1, SAA- 1, and SP- I 0 in bovine spermatozoa.  Indirect  immunotluorescence, using epifluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy, demonstrated that the antigens were localized to regions of bovine sperm similar to their human homologues. The antifertilization effects of the mabs were then tested in bovine in vitro fertilization (IVF) trials, using oocytes from ovaries obtained at an abattoir.  The addition of the FA- I mAb to the fertilization medium resulted in a linear decrease in fertilization rates (p [ 0.01). The S-AA-1 mAb had no affect (p ] 0. 10) on fertilization rates under any conditions used in this study. Three separate experiments demonstrated that SP- IO i-nabs and polyclonal antibodies reduced (p [ 0.01) fertilization rates of bovine oocytes in vitro. A sperm-zona pellucida tight bindin(i assay was performed in conjunction with the first SP-10 mAb IVF experiment which showed that the mAb reduced (p [ 0.01) the number of sperm tightly bound to the zona.  Functional trials were performed to determine how SP-I 0 mabs affected fertilization.  The results showed that SP-I 0 mabs reduced (p [ 0.01) the motility of capacitated sperm, reduced (p [ 0.01) the ability of capacitated sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction, and had no ettect (p ] 0.

It is found that the presence of the asymmetric nonlinear gain causes the longitudinal modes of Fabry-Perot lasers as well as nearly single-mode lasers to couple such that the low frequency RIN is greatly enhanced. This enhanced low frequency RIN can be translated to the signal band by beating with the modulation signal and contribute to the in-channel noise in high frequency applications. This can seriously degrade system's signal-to-noise performance. For the first time we have included the asymmetric mode competition to adequately model the enhanced low frequency noise and its translation to the signal channel in the presence of modulation and fiber dispersion. An experimental system, which provides a very sensitive means of noise measurement, was developed. The theoretical predictions were successfully verified by the experiments. Detailed investigations of system impairment caused by the enhanced in-channel noise, especially the degradation of system's signal-to-noise performance as a function of modulation depth, modulation frequency and fiber dispersion, were also performed. The results provide very important guidelines for system design and applications. Further, we adequately modeled laser's intermodulation distortion in the frequency range of 50MHz -- 10GHz. This model, which successfully explained the observed enhancement of low frequency IMD, was further generalized to include all the second-order and third-order IMDs of up to 60 channel signals, and was used to predict the impairment of multichannel lightwave systems. 0aOptical communications. 0aFiber optics. 0aTelecommunication systems. 0aSemiconductor lasers. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aSu, Chin B.,edegree supervisor.1 aChang, Kai,edegree committee member.1 aFry, Edward S.,edegree committee member.1 aTaylor, Henry F.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932876741xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1479627zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747687991&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs9e091e01-9d94-3ab0-8df2-2464d33e9915ia1d93f02-8027-3a7c-9a50-b2f9b1bee19703425ctm a2200529Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172043001200192049000900204099002900213100002600242245007900268264001000347300002800357336002600385337002800411338002700439504004100466500001000507502004100517500003000558520122800588650003301816650002401849650002701873650001901900650004601919650004301965650004302008651003702051655003902088655002702127700004102154700005002195700004802245700005002293710005802343856016902401856007802570856015602648994001202804999007902816in0000124238220200904152727.0950614s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32651519  9AGS9230AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)32651519  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaW3391 aWatson, Larry Jerome.10aEvangelical protestants and the prohibition movement in Texas, 1887-1919 / 1c1993.  aix, 292 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Despite the fact that the Texas political establishment was dominated by Anglo Protestants, Texans consistently resisted efforts by evangelical Protestants to enact constitutional prohibition until the emotions of World War One swayed public sentiment. In 1887, Texas voters overwhelmingly rejected statewide prohibition. In 1919, the long-term goal of prohibitionist Protestants was finally realized when Texas voters adopted a prohibition amendment to the state constitution. Fundamental to the frustration of statewide prohibition were the divisions and misconceptions of the evangelical Protestants. Complete unity never came to prohibitionist Protestant leadership, and the two major Protestant bodies, the Baptists and Methodists, struggled with ecclesiastical and ideological change. At the same time, prohibitionist assessment of the Texas populace was incorrect. Texans were not altogether controlled by evangelical Protestantism. Texans proved to be more pluralistic and heterogeneous than evangelical Protestant leadership perceived. 0aProhibitionzTexasxHistory. 0aProtestantszTexas. 0aEvangelicalismzTexas. 4aMajor history. 7aEvangelicalism.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00917002 7aProhibition.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01078761 7aProtestants.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079934 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKnobel, Dale T.,edegree supervisor.1 aCalvert, Robert A.,edegree committee member.1 aLenihan, John H.,edegree committee member.1 aMurdock, Steven H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932882041xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1482237zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747668191&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd7acd10c-a91b-3f33-bc1c-47e7f14207aaia231e2b9-c791-3ba5-9035-911e03a6bb7304029ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002900209245007400238264001000312300004600322336002600368337002800394338002700422504004100449500001000490502004100500500005400541520221000595650004302805655002702848700004302875700004402918700004802962700004503010710005803055856016903113856007803282856015603360994001203516999007903528in0000128398620200904152704.0960328s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34483349  9AGX6071AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34483349  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaF5351 aFisher, Mark Roy,d1960-14aThe relationship between nonresponse bias and angler specialization / 1c1993.  aviii, 80 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Angler surveys can yield inaccurate results because of the failure of some sampled units to return their questionnaire. Consequently, inferences made from the respondents to the population of interest will be subject to nonresponse bias. Using results adjusted for nonresponse, the size and number of angler specialization groups were estimated. Knowledge of the number and size of specialization groups can be used by fishery managers to relate the different types of experiences sought by the angler population. A 10-page mail questionnaire was sent to a stratified random sample of 9,981 Texas fishing license holders. Information was collected on fishing experience, fishing participation, species preferences, attitudes, and orientation to fisheries management efforts. A response rate of 62% was obtained (excluding non-deliverables). Adjustments for nonresponse were made using the method of response propensity stratification. Individual response probabilities were determined using logistic regression with a binary variable indicating response as the dependent variable and the external variables age, sex, race, and purchase date of fishing license. Response probabilities were inverted, sorted, and grouped into cells to obtain mean nonresponse adjustment weights. Statistically significant nonresponse bias was detected when unadjusted survey variables were compared with adjusted variables. The size and number of angler specialization groups were determined using cluster analysis. Four hierarchical methods were used to determine the number of groups, and a nonhierarchical method was used to determine the size of each group, with the number and starting means specified in advance. Seven specialization groups were recovered, ranging from 11% to 19% of the total population, after correcting for nonresponse bias. Groups were verified with external variables; attitudes toward management options, fishing tournament participation and fishing club membership were significantly different between groups... 4aMajor wildlife and fisheries sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDitton, Robert B.,edegree supervisor.1 aAdams, Clark,edegree committee member.1 aEltinge, John L.,edegree committee member.1 aMurphy, Brian,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941077141xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1525954zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745760041&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs245df33d-42d7-3b14-a4b1-e6f0966970b6ia2364072-ad90-3c44-b4f5-ec32a827db3803818ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004400109035002000153043001200173049000900185099002800194100003600222245010400258264001000362300004500372336002600417337002800443338002700471500002800498502004100526500001000567504004100577500003300618520195500651650004902606650004902655650003902704650002202743655002702765700004102792700004402833700004302877700004502920710005802965856007803023856015603101994001203257999007903269in0000110744820200904152552.0921123s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27017946  9AFU8939AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27017946  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaJ331 aJanousek, Thomas Edward,d1961-14aThe bionomics and ecology of Culex salinarius Coq.

However, during the summer they were generally restricted to cool aquatic habitats protected from exposure by direct sunlight. These protected habitats most commonly occur in the brackish marshes located along the coastal regions of the county. A fire effectively eliminated Cx. salinarius larval breeding within a brackish marsh during the summer of 1989 by removing the protective canopy of emergent vegetation thereby exposing water in breeding sites to the warming effects of direct sunlight. An attempt to use clear-cutting of vegetation to reduce Cx. salinarius breeding in this area was not successful. Adult populations were found year round in Chambers County with peak densities in April/May and September /October. Individual broods of mosquitoes were influenced by amount of rainfall and ambient temperatures. The largest females were collected in colder months and from light traps close to the coast of Chambers County. Regardless of the season, Cx. salinarius had two primary peaks of flight activity: one just after sunset and the other just before sunrise. These peaks are determined by changes in light intensity. During the colder months of the year these peaks occur closer to twilight hours of early evening and early morning than during the warmer months. Peaks in flight activity also occurred during the night and were influenced by the appearance of the full moon and low wind. Flight activity was reduced by high wind, heavy precipitation and cold temperatures. Fewer intermediate peaks in flight activity were observed on new moon nights than on full moon nights. Flight activity on full moon nights was strongly correlated with collections of females in CDC light traps. On new moon nights more female Cx. salinarius were collected by light trap than than by cartop trap. 0aMosquitoesxEcologyzTexaszChambers County. 0aMosquitoesxControlzTexaszChambers County. 0aMosquitoesxSeasonal distribution. 4aMajor entomology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aOlson, Jimmy K.,edegree supervisor.1 aMeola, R.

A group of 26 male grass frogs (Rana pipiens) were size matched and placed into two groups, a drug group (D) and a control group (C). Following a four week feeding and acclimatization period, the D group received an oral dose of fenoterol at a dosage of 2.0mg/kg/day for eight weeks. The C group was given an equal volume (1.5ml) of distilled water. At the end of the eight weeks, the animals were sacrificed and the sartorius muscles were removed. Muscles were electrically stimulated using a series of five tetanizing trains (>90v, 100Hz for 300ms) separated by a 120 sec rest interval and peak tetanic tensions (PPT) were recorded. Muscles were then blotted and weighed. Total protein content of each muscle was computed from nitrogen content using the micro-kjeldahl technique. Gel electrophoresis and densitometry were used to measure myosin content (MTOT) as an indicator of contractile protein content. No significant difference in sartorius weight was seen in the drug versus control group (p<.0709). Additionally, there was no significant difference between groups in the values for total protein (p<.666) or myosin to total protein ration (p<.075).  Myosin content was 23.6% greater in the D group (D=11.65mg, C=9.41mg), and peak tetanic tension was 13.9% (D=72.57, C=63.72) greater in the D group compared to controls. MANCOVA showed a statistically significant difference between groups (Wilke's criterion=0.7428, p<.038). These results confirm the ergogenic nature of the β2 agonist, fenoterol, since it does indeed increase myosin content and performance when administered over a prolonged period.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747348101&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6df96e2e-c8ab-3572-9de0-5daef8ac67a5ia36712d5-6de3-34e3-8f1e-aa26a9bc8f9803898ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100004500209245008900254264001000343300004700353336002600400337002800426338002700454504004100481500001000522502004100532500003700573520207500610650002602685655002702711700004502738700004602783700004902829700004602878710005802924856016902982856007803151856015603229994001203385999007903397in0000127561920200904152720.0960411s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34551866  9AGY1272AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34551866  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaR6961 aRodriguez Garcia, Carlos Agustin,d1962-10aSemi-automatic analysis of the ocular pursuit response during ethanol intoxication / 1c1993.  axiii, 213 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Four distinct ethanol-induced, ocular responses have been described in humans: positional alcohol nystagmus (PAN); optokinetic alcohol nystagmus (OKAN); alcohol gaze nystagmus (AGN), also called lateral alcohol gaze nystagmus; and pursuit alcohol response (PAR). This study focuses on the effects that ethanol has on eye displacement and velocity during sinusoidal ocular pursuit in order to develop an optimal regression model that describes the horizontal pursuit alcohol response, PAR, and estimates blood alcohol concentration (BAC). The monocular electro-oculogram (EOG) responses of sixteen college-age males were recorded under varying blood alcohol levels at two single-frequency sinusoidal stimuli (0.25 Hz and 0.50 Hz). The pursuit EOG was analyzed to detect and classify fast events and differentiate such events from smooth pursuit and slow phase components of eye movements before calculating important parameters related to eye displacement and velocity. The fast event and smooth pursuit parameters were entered as independent variables in multiple regression models (monocular and combined) to determine the relative and absolute correlations between BAC and oculomotor parameters. The purpose of this study was twofold: 1.) to determine if the alcohol nystagmus phenomenon and the impairment of the central nervous system due to ethanol could be detected by computer during single-frequency ocular pursuit tasks; and 2.) to determine if BAC can be estimated non-invasively from ocular pursuit responses. Three types of models, two monocular models (Right Eye, Left Eye) and one combined model (Left and Right Eyes) under two categories (Relative and Absolute), were developed using the responses from all the subjects. The Relative models were developed with measurements relative to the baseline (i.e., measurements at BAC=0.00%); the Absolute models were developed with the actual measurements... 4aMajor bioengineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLessard, Charles S.,edegree supervisor.1 aHunter, Jon F.,edegree committee member.1 aHyman, William A.,edegree committee member.1 aRastegar, Sohi,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941086541xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1531009zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745760471&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd6b49732-b770-380a-8884-23916db15ad0ia4531bba-4b5a-30a8-8d5b-4cf2a2f8059c03948ctm a2200493Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005800109035002000167043001200187049000900199099003000208100002400238245013200262264001000394300003000404336002600434337002800460338002700488500002800515502004100543500001000584504004100594500005200635520192100687650005102608650003502659650002502694650004102719650005402760651003702814655002702851700004502878700004302923700005402966700005103020710005803071856007803129856015603207994001203363999007903375in0000112811220200904152638.0930401s1992    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27838239  9AFW7751AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)27838239  an-us---  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaS69851 aSong, Hywan,d1942-10aDemographic, religious profiles, and cultural assimilation of three groups of Korean seminarians in Houston and Dallas, Texas / 1c1992.  axiii, 195 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The data for this study were obtained from three groups of 60 Korean students at Houston Theological Seminary and Dallas Theological Seminary. These respondents consisted of 21 Houston Theological Seminary students, and 39 Dallas Theological Seminary students, of which 21 were immigrating students and 18 were non-immigrating students. The Questionnaire on Socioeconomic and Demographic Characteristics, the Profile of Seminarians (POS), and the Sociocultural Assimilation Questionnaire (SAQ) were administered to the respondents. The major findings that emerged from the analysis of the data in this study are as follows: First, there were differences between Houston and Dallas Theological Seminary students in 12 demographic variables and between Korean immigrating and non-immigrating students at the Dallas Theological Seminary in four out of 16 demographic variables as measured by the Questionnaire on Socioeconomic and Demographic Characteristics. Second, generally speaking, Houston and Dallas seminary students were not different on religious orientation as measured by The Profile of Seminarians. Differences were found in only 22 variables out of 103 variables of the instrument. Differences in two variables were found between immigrating and non-immigrating students at the Dallas Theological Seminary. In terms of demography and religious orientation, immigrating and non-immigrating students were homogeneous. Third, differences in 12 out of the 24 variables measured by the Sociocultural Assimilation Questionnaire were found among the three groups. In general, Houston seminary students reported the lowest cultural assimilation among three seminary groups. 0aKorean studentsxCultural assimilationzTexas. 0aSeminarianszTexasxAttitudes. 0aDemographic surveys. 4aMajor adult and extension education. 7aSeminariansxAttitudes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01112285 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBeatty, Paulette T.,edegree supervisor.1 aStone, Barbara N.,edegree supervisor.1 aChristiansen, James E.,edegree committee member.1 aPaprock, Kenneth E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1293004zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747448361&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs97dfc726-6769-3dbc-8de2-d429e72b0388ia65ca974-2068-39db-88d5-1131bb2a115a03338ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002800218245011600246264001000362300004600372336002600418337002800444338002700472504004100499500001000540502004100550500003200591520153800623650001302161650004502174650002102219650002902240650002102269655002702290700004302317700004402360700004702404700004602451710005802497856007802555856015602633994001202789999007902801in0000120799420200904152625.0941128s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31521995  9AGP4982AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31521995  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaK1661 aKang, Seong-Joo,d1959-10aSyntheses, structures, and stereospecific FSBO/ESBO/MONO interconversions of rhodium(III) phosphine complexes / 1c1992.  axii, 160 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

X-ray lithography is an ideal candidate technology for the production of microelectronic devices with sizes between 0.3-0.5 microns. Industrial x-ray lithography requires the x-ray source, which is the electron storage ring, to be as compact and reliable as possible. In this thesis I review and develop the basic physical principles governing the design of compact electron synchrotrons for x-ray lithography. I explore the various aspects of lattice design for this application. I argue that the optimal storage ring design consists of a four fold symmetric cell lattice with two quadrupole families and 90° zero gradient dipole magnets. I demonstrate that radiation requirements for lithography and the use of zero gradient magnetic dipole fields constrains the lattice to four or more dipole magnets. I develop a lattice design for x-ray lithography following this logic. I then develop a dipole magnet design for a machine using this lattice. Particle tracking data is integrated into the magnet design and used to optimize the end coil configurations of the magnets. I then review the magnet's physical construction and measurement. I develop a cryogenic Hall probe mapping apparatus for this magnet and measure its excitation curves. 0aSynchrotron radiation. 0aStorage ringsxDesign. 0aX-ray lithography. 4aMajor physics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHuson, F.

By superimposing the painted building design from the computer-aided design (CAD) system onto a digitized image of the intended location, a composite image was achieved. These techniques have advantages in creating realistic composite images of proposed building designs in their intended location within a short period of time. In order to provide more visual clues, a multiple view presentation was examined. In addition, the research attempted to present the video-computer in an animation sequence. This was done by creating a series of sequential composite images, and recording them frame by frame onto the video tape. Then, the animation presentation was played back in real time. The animation presentations were evaluated by comparing them with the multiple view presentations. Manual rendering and single viewpoint displays were also included in the comparisons in order to aid in interpretation of the results. Questionnaires were used to measure the capability of each presentation format in communicating the building design information to non-architecturally trained persons. The results indicate that video-computer presentations were equal to or better than manual rendering. The video-computer presentations, with their short production time, were more practical to use in the architectural process than the conventional presentations. The results of the comparisons revealed that video-computer presentations in animation format were superior to those of multiple view format in the depth cue category. On the other hand, video-computer presentations by multiple view format was found to be superior to animation format in communicating both size and scale. These results occurred under the different complexity levels of the buildings used. 0aImaging systems. 0aArchitectural designxData processing. 0aCommunication in architectural design. 4aMajor architecture. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDegelman, Larry O.,edegree supervisor.1 aBerke, Philip R.,edegree committee member.1 aLarsen, Terry R.,edegree committee member.1 aShebilske, Wayne L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910699341xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1118188zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744838961&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs61d8ad43-2039-325d-bb73-8c546cac10d1iaa2961da-fc62-3620-85e2-c66d6ed69a8a03960ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099003000168100001900198245009200217264001000309300004600319336002600365337002800391338002700419504004100446500001000487502004100497500003900538520236300577650002802940655002702968700004202995700004403037700004103081700004503122710005803167856015603225856007803381994001203459999007903471in0000129901820200904152729.0960603s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34844149  9AHA5758AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34844149  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaD58441 aDing, Jianxun.10aDesign and analysis of buffered Multistage Interconnection Networks /cby Jianxun Ding. 1c1994.  axiv, 153 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Thus, design and analysis of high performance MIN architecture have become very important.  This dissertation addresses the following issues relating to the design and analysis of buffered multistage interconnection networks (MINs): (1) Design of a novel synchronization clock and analysis of its performance in comparison to the existing clock design, (2) Design of a new multi-queue buffer allocation scheme and development of a unified analytical model for analyzing various multi-queue buffer allocation schemes, (3) Performance evaluation of nonuniform traffic load for various buffering strategies, and (4) Performance analysis of adaptive buffer splitting, and priority-based selection strategies in MINs.  Traditional MIN design used a big synchronization clock to transfer a package from one stage to the next. This design is difficult to scale because the clock cycle length depends on the network size. We propose a small synchronization clock cycle design that is independent of the network size and thus is easy to implement. Its performance is also shown to be better than the big cycle design.  Buffer design and allocations have significant effects on the system performance. We propose a new Dynamically Allocated Fully Connected (DAFC) scheme and show that it performs better than the existing schemes by developing a unified analytical model.  Most performance evaluation of interconnection networks focuses on uniform analysis. In reality, applications involve many nonuniform traffic patterns. Nonuniform traffic can further be classified into symmetric and arbitrary patterns. We first develop an analytical model to evaluate various buffer allocation schemes under arbitrary traffic patterns and show that the DAFC scheme we have proposed has the best performance over the existing buffer schemes under both uniform and nonuniform load.  We also develop an analytical model to evaluate a typical symmetric nonuniform pattern--favorite load which has applications in both multiprocessor systems and ATM switches. By using this analytical model, we investigate performance features under different priority-based selection policies and buffer splitting strategies. 4aMajor computer science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBhuyan, Laxmi N.,edegree supervisor.1 aNelson, Paul,edegree committee member.1 aZhao, Wei,edegree committee member.1 aWatson, Karan,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326161&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554326zLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsbd8b88bc-2083-374d-ab4a-9dda28fa7a7fiaa29fcbe-0ae3-3c07-9151-07b1745638db03505ctm a2200445Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003300218245007900251264001000330300004300340336002600383337002800409338002700437500002800464502004100492500001000533504004100543500004700584520168900631650006502320650004602385650003602431655002702467700004202494700004502536700004902581700004602630710005802676856007802734856015602812994001202968999007902980in0000112739420200904152641.0930326s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27808154  9AFW7736AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27808154  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaV1431 aValco, Thomas Donald,d1952-14aThe development and evaluation of aircraft chemical injection principles / 1c1992.  ax, 86 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

A high pressure injection system was installed on the aircraft and performance was evaluated. Chemical formulation rate was controlled independent of spray rate by variation of formulation concentration within the spray mixture. Experiments were conducted to evaluate mixing uniformity and accuracy with respect to injection equipment and locations. Two different metering pumps (peristaltic and plunger) and three different injection locations (pump intake, boom supply line and nozzle body) were tested on a sprayer test stand. The time required to displace the liquid volume between the injection point and the nozzle with a new concentration, response time, was determined using a water soluble dye and colorimeter. For the different configurations tested, injection at the nozzle provided the fastest response to change in dye concentration. A chemical injection system was installed on a spray aircraft and tested for performance and accuracy. A dye concentrate was injected into the boom supply line just before to the y-strainer. Metering pump flow rate was based on aerial application parameters of speed, swath width and formulation rate. Injection accuracy and mixing uniformity were compared for the injection system and for conventional tank mixing and fell within the [plus or minus] 10% desired accuracy range. However, response time of the system did cause application errors on initial start-up and during on/off spray valve operation. During testing, no dye contaminated the spray tank hopper and the aircraft spray delivery system could be easily purged of dye mixture. 0aAerial spraying and dusting in agriculturexSafety measures. 0aPesticidesxApplicationxSafety measures. 4aMajor agricultural engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLePori, Wayne A.,edegree supervisor.1 aBouse, L .

In a greenhouse study, germination of stratified and non-stratified willow oak (Quercus phellos) acorns decreased following submergence for 90 d, whereas germination of the more water-tolerant overcup oak (Q. lyrata) peaked during this treatment.  Experimental studies on the effects of timing and duration of flooding on BLHW seedling growth and survival were conducted on Texas Utilities' Big Brown Mine in Fairfield, Texas. The order of survival within each of the three treatments was from the most to least water-tolerant species and was as follows: baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), overcup oak, Nuttall oak (Q. texana), willow oak, and Shumard oak (Q. shumardii). Baldcypress exhibited significantly (P $<$.05) greater growth than hardwoods in all three treatments.  Field studies conducted within two green-tree reservoirs (GTR) in east Texas indicated that overcup oak seedling establishment and survival was related negatively to duration of flooding. Stress and mortality of overstory trees differed inter- and intra-specifically. Temporal and spatial patterns of overstory mortality suggested mortality was a result of cumulative flooding events over a series of years rather than the amount of flooding in any single year. Stand-structure analyses indicated regeneration had been limited in both impoundments in the recent past, possibly before the pre-impoundment period.  A simulation model, GTREE, was constructed to evaluate the effects of GTR management on seedling growth and survival of overcup oak, water elm (Planera aquatica), and willow oak. The number of seedlings reaching sapling height and the time needed to reach sapling height were dependent upon duration of time flooded during the growing season, the dormant-season flood depth, and light availability. Regeneration was limited as light availability or the duration of time flooded during the growing season approached an extreme for that species. 4aMajor wildlife and fisheries sciences. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aWeller, Milton W.,edegree supervisor.1 aGrant, William E.,edegree committee member.1 aMessina, Michael G.,edegree committee member.1 aSilvy, Nova J.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.42uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:9432711zLink to OAKTrust Copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740896161&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzProQuest, Abstract41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1514344zLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 2 OTHER HOLDINGSffsbaf41a08-405a-3578-8e68-84a4ae24a5ebiab5897bf-50e1-3cea-a2be-632335df782503683ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100004100218245006200259264001000321300004600331336002600377337002800403338002700431500002800458502004100486500001000527504004100537500004400578520189700622650003102519650002402550650003202574650003302606655002702639700003902666700004602705700004702751700004402798710005802842856007802900856015602978994001203134999007903146in0000107492320200904152600.0921002s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm26713781  9AFR7132AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)26713781  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaP4381 aPérez Cardoza, Jorge Mario,d1960-10aMRI study of imbibition flooding using carbonated water / 1c1991.  axix, 137 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Conventional secondarty methods cannot be applied to this type of reservoirs because injected fluids channel though the fractures bypassing oil trapped in the matrix blocks. Spontaneous water imbibition is an spontaneous mechanism that could be applied. The process exchanges oil inside the rock matrix for surrounding water filling the fractures. However, the process is very time dependent. Oil distribution inside carbonated rock samples, and the effects of introducing CO2 into the water being imbibed were studied using Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI. Oil saturation profiles and longitudinal images along the sample were used to monitor water imbibition. A high pressure core holder suitable for MRI and CT applications was developed using commercial fiber glass tubing. Development of the new tool permitted imbibition of unadulterated and carbonated water to be studied at a reservoir pressure of 2000 psi. Different cases were studies: (1) Imbibition of unadulterated water, (2) Imbibition of CO2 - enriched water, and (3) Cyclic CO2 - enriched water imbibition and pressure depletion. Introduction of CO2 into the water being imbibed showed improvements in oil recovery rates during early times of the process. Pressure depletion caused expansion of gas dissolved into the imbibed water. This mechanism probed to cause a substantial oil increase. Oil recovery by CO2 - enriched water imbibition and pressure depletion were combined to develop a cyclic method that integrated the beneficial effects encountered at early times and gas expansion caused by pressure depletion. The cyclic method reduced recovery time to nearly one third of the time needed to produce similar amounts of oil by pure water imbibition. 0aSecondary recovery of oil. 0aOil field flooding. 0aMagnetic resonance imaging. 4aMajor petroleum engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPoston, S.

TMO is involved in the bacterial production of auxin. The enzyme was overexpressed in and purified to homogeneity from E coli. Steady state and rapid reaction kinetic methods were used to study the reaction with L-tryptophan at pH 8.3 and 25 °C. The reduction of TMO by L-tryptophan was consistent with equilibrium binding of substrate followed by two reversible steps. The first step was isotope sensitive with a rate constant of 115 s e c 1, while the second had a rate constant of 2.5 s e c 1. Indole-pyruvate was formed with a rate constant of 107 sec*1, consistent with all of the chemistry occurring during the isotope sensitive step. Oxygen reacted with the reduced enzyme oxidized substrate complex with a rate constant of 195 mM*1 sec*1. The rate constant for product release was calculated to be 14.9 sec*1. The substrate's amino group and a group on the enzyme with a pKa of 6.0 had to be protonated; deprotonation of a group on the enzyme with a pKa of 10 increased activity. Deprotonation of a group with a pKa of 8.5 resulted in an increase in V/K02(met) value but had no effect on V/K02(trp) ° r V/K02(phe)- Deprotonation of a group on the enzyme increased Vmax; the pKa of this group was 6.3 with L-methionine, 7.7 with L-phenylalanine and 8.5 with Ltryptophan. DV/K(trp) values were small, consistent with a high forward commitment. At high or low pH the °V/Kmet value was 5.2. The °V/Kala value at pH 8.3 was 5.3. The P°V/Kala value was 0.96±0.04; this is inconsistent with a hydride transfer mechanism. DVmax values with Ltryptophan and L-phenylalanine at pH 8.3 were small, consistent with product release being rate limiting. 4aMajor biochemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aFitzpatrick, Paul F.,edegree supervisor.1 aPace, C.N.,edegree committee member.1 aRaushel, Frank M.,edegree committee member.1 aPark, William,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741324841&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554299zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741324841&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffse5d772be-b9b6-3233-9335-0907d8c45b37iabc833ac-5ad1-32f2-9251-730b4168fd5b03888ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003000218245013200248264001000380300004500390336002600435337002800461338002700489500002800516502004100544500001000585504004100595500003200636520206100668650002302729650003602752650002702788650002102815655002702836700004302863700004302906700004902949700004902998710005803047856007803105856015603183994001203339999007903351in0000116055820200904152637.0931014s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm29012465  9AGD3278AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)29012465  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaS6451 aSmith, Dana Renee,d1965-10aUse of palmitoleate and myristoleate to establish the effects of fatty acid chain length and saturation on plasma cholesterol / 1c1992.  axii, 88 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Weanling pigs were assigned to six groups and each group received a diet differing in the main fatty acid. Diets were fed for 35 days and contained 0 (control group) or 10% added fat (by wet weight). The dietary fats contained approximately 40% myristoleate and palmitoleate combined (14:1/16:1 diet), 55% palmitate (16:0), 55% stearate (18:0), 55% oleate (18:1), or 40% linoleate (18:2). All diets contained 35% myristate. Blood samples were obtained at one week post weaning prior to the feeding trial and then at weeks 1, 3, and 5 of the feeding trial. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were quantitated with Sigma Diagnostics reagents, and lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was measured with the Quantimetrix LipoPhor System. Fatty acid composition of the plasma, longissimus tissue, and adipose tissue was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in weight gain throughout the study. Total cholesterol increased from approximately 80 mg/100 mL (pretreatment) to 138 (control), 152 (18:0), 157 (16:0), 194 (18:2), 209 (14:1/16;1) and 209 (18:1) mg/100 mL by 21 days on the test diets. Triglycerides increased from an average of 32 mg/100 mL (baseline) to 66 mg/100 mL (day 21) (no differences among treatment groups). The average amounts of LDL and HDL cholesterol increased from 33 and 37 mg/100 mL (baseline) to 69 and 90 mg/100 mL (day 21), respectively. Differences in plasma and tissue fatty acid composition were reflective of the diets. Plasma myristate was elevated at weeks 1 and S in all groups except for the control group. The monounsaturated fatty acid mixture resulted in increased plasma myristoleate and palmitoleate. Also, plasma linoleate was elevated in the group fed the high-linoleate diet. In both lean and adipose tissues, myristoleate was greater in the group fed the monounsaturated fatty acid mixture... 0aBlood cholesterol. 0aFatty acids in human nutrition. 0aFatty acidsxAnalysis. 4aMajor nutrition. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aCross, H.

While never having held independent command over so large a force, Buller had an excellent reputation for leadership and courage. He had fought in most of the major Victorian campaigns, earning great distinction. He held the Victorian Cross. Britain's highest award for bravery, as well as several orders of knighthood. He had also advanced rapidly in the officer corps of the British Army, earning rank through meritorious service more rapidly than most men of his age and experience. In addition. Buller spent ten years at the War Office, as a reformer in a period usually considered devoid of Army reform, and a year in Ireland where his reputation for strength, courage and determination were to have solved the impossible situation there. Despite this background, within months after the Boer War began, Buller had been demoted, his reputation was in tatters, and his characteristics of courage and leadership called into question. Ultimately, he would be forced to retire prematurely from the Army. This dissertation will examine the life of Sir Redvers Buller in order to learn the bases for his reputation and to look at the events which led to his dismissal.

In addition, weight was given to achene micromorpholgy in the final placement of taxa into their respective complex. The two complexes are: the C. muhlenbergii complex consisting of C. austrina, C. muhlenbergii var. enervis, and C. muhlenbergii var. muhlenbergii, and the C. cephalophora complex consisting of C. cephalophora, C. leavenworthii, C. mesochorea and a newly described species from Texas and Oklahoma, C. perdentata. Carex mesochorea and C. perdentata have papillose leaves similar to the taxa in the C. muhlenbergii complex. However, the absence of satellites on the surface of the epidermal cells of the achenes removes them from that complex.  Type specimens of the previously described taxa were found with the exception of C. muhlenbergii var. muhlenbergii and C. muhlenbergii var. enervis. Carex muhlenbergii var. muhlenbergii is lectotypified. Although the type specimen for C. muhlenbergii var. enervis was not found, it is presumed to be intact. In addition, section Phaestoglochin is typified with Carex muricata.  A dichotomous key is provided to separate the taxa of these two complexes. A set of characters was established for comparable diagnoses for the members of the two complexes and will serve to study the other members of section Phaestoglochin and closely allied sections. Achene micromorphology was shown to be valuable characters for separating complexes, species, and varieties. Pollen analyses provided a base line for these two complexes with other members of section Phaestoglochin, but were not shown to be taxonomically signifiant. Taxa of these two complexes range from Texas east to Florida, north to Minnesota and west to Quebec, Canada. Distribution maps of each taxon are also provided. 0aCarex muhlenbergii. 0aCarex cephalophora. 0aCyperaceaezUnited States. 0aBotanyzUnited States. 4aMajor range science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHatch, Stephan L.,edegree supervisor.1 aCox, Elenor R.,edegree committee member.1 aFryxell, Paul A.,edegree committee member.1 aSweet, Merrill H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900101&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551773zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900101&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs428e8abc-6a9e-3d79-9c08-b9a7ff8eca44iad70b936-c1c9-3263-ae4c-30232086c96d03850ctm a2200493Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002600218245009900244264001000343300004500353336002600398337002800424338002700452504004100479500001000520502004100530500004500571520167900616650004702295650004702342650001502389650003402404650004102438650007302479650007302552655002702625700004202652700005102694700004502745700005002790710005802840856015602898856007803054856013303132994001203265999007903277in0000125707420200904152729.0951101s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm33402349  9AGV4635AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)33402349  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaD8781 aDulas, Rick Lawrence.10aLane deviation as a result of visual workload and manual data entry /cby Rick Lawrence Dulas. 1c1994.  axii, 84 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The introduction of Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems, cellular phones, and other complicated in-vehicle controls will impose higher attentional demand loads than have currently been seen. Lane keeping is a critical performance measure for safe driving. This study looked at the effect of driver age, type of data entry (manual or verbal), and vertical position of a data display panel on lane keeping performance. The experimental tasks were similar to those found in in-vehicle navigation systems and cellular phones. A no-load condition was studied to establish a baseline for the performance measures. Both older and younger drivers exhibit lateral deviations of approximately 15 cm under no-load conditions. Under manual data entry conditions all drivers exhibited lateral lane deviations in excess of the no-load condition. Lateral deviations greater than 0.5 meters occurred in 6.2% of all manual data entry trials. The maximum deviation recorded was over 2 meters. Verbal data entry of data was clearly superior to manual data entry for all measures. Younger drivers consistently performed better than older drivers with lower errors and faster time to complete experimental trials. However there was no difference between driver age groups for lane keeping performance. While placing the data display panel in high position yielded better performance for all measures. A substudy found no significant difference in lateral deviation between driving at 35 miles per hour and 55 miles per hour. 0aAutomobilesxInstrumentsxDisplay systems. 0aAutomobile drivingxPhysiological aspects. 0aAttention. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAttention.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00820788 7aAutomobile drivingxPhysiological aspects.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00822919 7aAutomobilesxInstrumentsxDisplay systems.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00823523 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKoppa, Rodger J.,edegree supervisor.1 aHuchingson, R.

Cluster secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was evaluated in comparison to plasma desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) and monoatomic SIMS. A cluster ion source was designed based on the spontaneous desorption (SD) process. The parameters affecting the SD were studied to optimize the cluster source performance. These factors were extraction grid vs. aperture, aperture size, source bias, source distance, and time. Under optimized SD conditions signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) up to approximately 27 were obtained for the production of CsI cluster ions. The ions of interest from the source were I' and (CsI)[n]I' clusters (where n is the cluster order). For our source a 3 mm gridless aperture 8 mm from the source foil produced the highest signal-to-noise ratio at 18 kV on the source. A signal-to-noise maximum was reached after the sample was biased for 12 hours. The SI yields from organic targets were compared for monoatomic keV ions, MeV ions (252Cf fission fragments), and polyatomic keV ions. The energy range of the clusters used was 18 to 27 keV. This comparison was made by calculating secondary ion yields for the molecular ions from a given sample. The organic samples used were epinephrine, γ-aminobutyric acid, phenylalanine, and valine. For cluster bombardment secondary ion yields ranged from 0.53% for epinephrine to 3.45% for phenylalanine. These yields are less than the molecular ion yields from PDMS which ranged from 3.09% for epinephrine to 7.00% for phenylalanine. The secondary ion yields for monoatomic bombardment were 0.05% for epinephrine and 0.29% for phenylalanine. The higher yields observed with cluster primary ions are attributed to an enhancement effect related to the number of constituents in a cluster...41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746243731&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs278ae13b-5336-3373-af47-34c61ae7221diaf4029de-8c60-361e-acee-96476125d46502749ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006100109035002000170049000900190099002900199100002100228245008100249264001000330300004500340336002600385337002800411338002700439504004100466500001000507502004100517500003200558520069100590650004501281650002801326650004701354650003001401650002101431655005201452655002701504700004301531700005201574700004201626700004701668710005801715856016901773856007801942856015602020994001202176999007902188in0000121662020200904152658.0950410s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32282939  9AGS0865AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32282939  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaF2131 aFann, Lih-Jiuan.10aStability and change in coping patterns in adolescence and young adulthood / 1c1993.  aix, 114 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Covering at six, four, and two weeks before harvest, and no cover were tested in the majority of the experiments. Also tested were different plant and row spacings as well as planting systems. Manual and mechanical covering were applied in different experiments. The onion shoulder color was measured with a tristimulus colorimeter. The color characterization was done with the Hunter Lab scale. Several whiteness indexes were calculated. Early covering, four to six weeks before harvest, clearly reduced shoulder greening and increased whiteness in all the white onion varieties tested. Covering did not have a detrimental effect on yield. Mechanical cover was satisfactorily performed with three-spider rolling cultivators. Early covering did not have an effect on the incidence of rots. Direct seeded onions on two rows, 25 cm apart on 1 m beds, in the bottom of a furrow constructed on top of bed, appeared as a promising system for the Rio Grande Valley Area. Transplanted onions on two rows, 10 to 15 cm apart on 1 m wide beds resulted satisfactory for the High Plains Area. 0aOnionsxColorzTexas. 0aPlant pigmentszTexas. 0aAgricultural mechanicszTexas. 4aMajor horticulture. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPike, Leonard M.,edegree supervisor.1 aBender, David A.,edegree committee member.1 aCoble, Charlie G.,edegree committee member.1 aMiller, Marvin E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:901544441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1035389zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746088181&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd536fa2d-4c1e-3a25-b378-acc7efa6f118ib0520370-539f-3cea-a331-a244a058107903884ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040007000109035002000179049000900199099002900208100002700237245010500264264001000369300004600379336002600425337002800451338002700479500002800506502004100534500001000575504004100585500004000626520185000666650004202516650002902558650003602587650002902623655002702652700004302679700004502722700004902767700004602816710005802862856016902920856007803089856015603167994001203323999007903335in0000107680820200904152600.0920407s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm25602099  9AFQ0459AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCGdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)25602099  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaP4331 aPerdomo, Dario,d1960-10aInfluence of sand-sized aggregate particles on permanent deformation in asphalt concrete pavements / 1c1991.  axiv, 194 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The influence that these particles have on permanent deformation is investigated in this research study. A comprehensive field evaluation is presented to prove that physical characteristics of sand-size aggregate particles have a strong influence on rutting. A detailed laboratory investigation is carried out in order to (1) quantify the influence on resistance to rutting when rounded, smooth, sand-sized aggregate particles are replaced by rough, angular, porous particles, and (2) evaluate the ability of test procedures to identify good rutting resistant mixtures, based on the quality of the sand-sized particles. A state of the art theoretical approach is described and developed. In this approach, hyperbolic equations are introduced to model the compressive creep and recovery compliances, and the aggregate's role in the permanent deformation behavior of the mixture is assessed by means of a new parameter: the "p" value. The new compliance equations are further developed into a rutting prediction model. A new technique based on image processing is applied to the characterization of texture in sand-sized aggregate particles. The technique is known as fractal analysis. Octahedral shear stress theory is used to evaluate potential to rutting of asphalt concrete mixes containing low quality sand-sized particles (rounded, smooth, non-porous) and high quality sand-sized particles (rough, angular, porous). A combination of the new theoretical approach, the laboratory long-term performance of the mix, and the octahedral shear stress analysis, is recommended as the preferred approach to evaluate the influence of sand-sized aggregate particles on permanent deformation in asphalt concrete mixtures. 0aPavements, Asphalt concretexTesting. 0aDeformations (Mechanics) 0aAggregates (Building materials) 4aMajor civil engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLittle, Dallas N.,edegree supervisor.1 aHart, Jeffrey,edegree committee member.1 aLytton, Robert L.,edegree committee member.1 aSaylak, Donald,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913398741xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1235794zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747613691&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6038b71a-0bc4-347b-b4f8-4b1025105c18ib122973f-531b-3813-93e8-1d48c868eac303350ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002800218245005700246264001000303300004700313336002600360337002800386338002700414500002800441502004100469500001000510504004100520500004500561520158300606650002202189650002002211650002502231650003402256655002702290700004302317700004702360700004702407700005502454710005802509856007802567856015602645994001202801999007902813in0000112815420200904152622.0930415s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27924325  9AFW7801AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27924325  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaH8741 aHuang, Chenhong,d1963-10aPath integral method in classical electromagnetics / 1c1992.  axiii, 130 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

An analytical solution for the Green's function in multi-dimensional free space and some two-dimensional perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary value problems which are amenable to classical solutions prove that our formulations are rigorous and exact. Two numerical techniques for the evaluation of the path integrals are developed and their relative merits discussed. One of them, called the stationary phase Monte Carlo (SPMC) method, which is found to be particularly well suited for wave propagation over long distances, is implemented to analyze wave propagation in a system involving arbitrary-shaped, smoothly varying, and transversely inhomogeneous dielectrics. The other technique, called the Fourier transform path integral (FTPI) method, which provides a unified treatment for computing electromagnetic fields in a region that contains intersecting or isolated dielectric bodies that are homogeneous, inhomogeneous or perfect conductors, is implemented to analyze general wave scattering in one- or two-dimensional configurations. The SPMC method is specifically applied to wave propagation in a graded-index waveguide, while the FTPI method is used to solve for the scattered field from a variety of one- and two-dimensional planar structures due to line source excitation. Numerical results sire presented and, wherever possible, compared with analytical solutions and data in the literature. 0aElectromagnetism. 0aPath integrals. 0aOptical wave guides. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aNevels, Robert D.,edegree supervisor.1 aFord, Albert L.,edegree committee member.1 aHuang, Garng M.,edegree committee member.1 aMichalski, Krzysztof A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1293046zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747656431&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2e77c57e-5f5d-3892-978e-33ce1912d0f7ib2f3dd4f-2783-301e-bb4c-4a6841ecde7804023ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002800218245007200246264001000318300004600328336002600374337002800400338002700428500002800455502004100483500001000524504004100534500004500575520225300620650002502873650001602898650002302914650003402937655002702971700004302998700004703041700005003088700004403138710005803182856007803240856015603318994001203474999007903486in0000113388320200904152627.0930422s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27964536  9AFY2745AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27964536  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaL5251 aLei, Chiang-Kuo,d1957-13aAn experimental comparison of robot kinematic calibration methods / 1c1992.  axiv, 166 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This research has involved using two different calibration methods, the CMM and VBAT, to calibrate PUMA 560 manipulator, and studied the relationship between the global and local calibration. The CMM method can measure the complete tool pose information with a special 5-tooling ball end effector, and the VBAT method can provide the partial tool pose measurement by using an automatic tracking camera which works as a single theodolite. In this work, the robot calibration procedure is based on a model which is the extension of the modified Hartenberg-Denavit model. The deviations between the kinematic model used in the robot controller and the actual kinematic structure of a given robot are in terms of the small perturbation of the parameters of the selected model. Since it is assumed that the acquired data will have measurement error, a least squares technique is employed to optimize the solution. Simulations are used to demonstrate that the selected model is adequate to model a six degree-of-freedom manipulator, to study the effect of the measurement error, and to show the data filter can work. The most important results is that the simulations show that the observability index can be misleading if the reliability of the data is not check first, this is never observed in previous work. Finally, the experimental data are used to compare the identified parameters of the two different methods, the prediction error of the global and local calibrations, and the existence of the unmodeled factors. The global and local calibrations results show that there are significant differences between them, and local calibration is an effective way to improve manipulator performance. The parameters identified by using a particular local space data can predict the position of the poses in that local space best, and get worse when the poses are further away the particular local space. The global calibration results show that the parameters identified by using the global space data can predict the position of the poses in the global space within a range which is worse than the results of local calibration in each local space. 0aRobotsxCalibration. 0aKinematics. 0aAutomatic control. 4aMajor mechanical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aEverett, Louis J.,edegree supervisor.1 aMcDermott, Make,edegree committee member.1 aRedfield, Robin C.,edegree committee member.1 aScogin, Neal,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1307075zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747653781&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsf8d6a943-42fa-39b0-a701-81ced27de415ib49be098-ce2b-34cf-baa6-8807e7d567fd04490ctm a2200493Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004900109035002000158043001200178049000900190099002900199100004000228245011100268264001000379300004700389336002600436337002800462338002700490500002800517502004100545500001000586504004100596500003600637520239900673650002903072650003503101650003303136650003403169650002503203655002703228700004303255700005003298700004703348700004903395710005803444856016903502856007803671856015603749994001203905999007903917in0000107325220200904152540.0920227s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm25353796  9AFP3077AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)25353796  ae-ic---  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaA6581 aAradóttir, Ása Lovísa,d1959-10aPopulation biology and stand development of birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) on disturbed sites in Iceland / 1c1991.  axiii, 104 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The objective of this research was to describe and quantify aspects of birch colonization and stand development on severely eroded sites, which could be used to develop strategies for landscape restoration. Patterns of birch colonization were inferred from age/size structure and spatial distribution of birch populations on disturbed sites in southern and northeastern Iceland. In addition, long-term changes in birch cover were quantified from aerial photographs. Increases in birch abundance occurred as existing birch clusters expanded and coalesced and produced seeds which germinated and initiated birch clusters that subsequently served as foci for additional colonization. Ectomycorrhizal infectivity, as estimated by the most probable number technique, was twenty-five to thirty-five times lower in soils from disturbed sites than observed for soil collected from a developing birch stand. Even so, mycorrhizae did develop on roots of birch seedlings grown on these disturbed soils in a controlled environment. The distribution of seedlings was quantified along belt transects radiating from birch clusters and isolated birch plants and related to seed rain and ground cover. Seed dispersal curves tended to be unimodal with a log-linear decrease in seed density with increased distance from the seed source. Patterns of seedling density seemed to reflect the interaction between seed rain and the availability of safe-sites. Field experiments were designed to evaluate the suitability of some common microsites (mineral soil, gravel, rock, moss cushions, dwarf-shrub and grass) for birch seedling establishment. Germination from a one-time dissemination and seedling survival were monitored for two years. Seedling emergence was greater in non-vegetated than vegetated microsites, but seedling survival was generally lower in non-vegetated microsites. The majority of seedling mortality occurred during winter on all microsites. Suitability of non-vegetated microsites for seedling establishment was augmented by low-level fertilization that served to enhance overwinter survival. The results are discussed in relation to strategies for restoration of birch woodlands on eroded and disturbed sites. 0aBirchxEcologyzIceland. 0aDowny birchxEcologyzIceland. 0aPopulation biologyzIceland. 0aRestoration ecologyzIceland. 4aMajor range science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aArcher, Steven R.,edegree supervisor.1 aBoutton, Thomas W.,edegree committee member.1 aSmeins, Fred E.,edegree committee member.1 aZuberer, David A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913390641xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1229768zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747411721&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs8a487f0c-2786-3cd2-a48b-a68de31a2417ib4bb58ff-f25c-3983-8395-86a0690a7b3a03993ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003500109035002000144049000900164099003000173100002900203245006600232264001000298300004800308336002600356337002800382338002700410504004100437500001000478502004100488500003100529520223100560650002002791655002702811700004002838700004802878700004602926700004702972710005803019856016903077856007803246856015603324994001203480999007903492in0000130081220200904152732.0960516s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34743529  9AHA3295AM  aTXAbengcTXAdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34743529  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaL49931 aLege, Ken Edward,d1965-10aNitrogen fertility effects on ethylene production in cotton / 1c1994.  axxiii, 181 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

A field and two growth chamber studies were conducted to determine N fertility effects on ethylene production throughout development of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plants and plant parts. The association between changes in ethylene production due to N fertility and fruiting form abscission was also investigated. Nitrogen-deficient cotton plants exhibit increased rates of fruiting form abscission. Since ethylene is a potent promoter of abscission, it is implicated as a factor in this process. For all experiments, cotton plants were fertilized with NH4NO3 at planting at 0, 50, 100, or 150 kg N ha^-1. For the whole-plant study, ethylene production was measured using a flow-through system designed to collect ethylene from enclosed plants. Ethylene evolution from leaf discs of topmost fully expanded, middle, and bottom leaves of the canopy was determined in a growth chamber and a one-year field study. In addition, ethylene production from 3-d-old, 18-d-old, and 24-d-old squares, and 3-d-old bolls was sampled from field-grown plants. The whole-plant, growth chamber study was variable, but generally suggested ethylene production was increased for control plants. In addition, this response was unaffected by day temperature (28 or 35°C). Ethylene production of whole plants significantly decreased from 21 to 63 days after emergence (DAE). Ethylene evolution from leaf discs of the bottom leaves of the canopy of growth chamber-grown cotton plants was significantly increased for control plants at 14 DAE. However, from 21 to 42 DAE, ethylene production of those leaves increased with the amount of N applied. Older leaf tissue of field-grown cotton plants exhibited increased ethylene production with the amount of N applied, but only during the bloom period. Ethylene production by field-grown and growth chamber-grown plants increased with leaf age. Ethylene production by fruiting forms was not influenced by N fertilization, and abscission rates were not associated with ethylene production of fruiting forms, which suggested the fruit shed associated with a N deficiency might involve other hormones related to the abscission process. 4aMajor agronomy. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aCothren, J.

G. Don was characterized. Uptake of alkaloids by mesophyll protoplasts was found to have two components: a rapid, non-specific diffusion of the alkaloid, driven by the pH gradient between the vacuole and the external medium; and a slower, energy dependent uptake which was specific for at least some of the alkaloids endogenous to C. roseus. The concentration and pH dependence for uptake of vindoline suggested the rapid phase of uptake was due to non-mediated diffusion of the neutral form of vindoline. Uptake of nicotine, which is not endogenous to Catharanthus, also conformed to the kinetics of simple diffusion. In the case of vindoline, the second sustained phase of uptake could be selectively inhibited by pretreatment of the protoplasts with NaN3 for 10 min. Metabolism of the alkaloids was ruled out as a possible cause of the observed biphasic uptake. The importance of ion-trapping of the alkaloids inside the cell was demonstrated by a rapid efflux of both vindoline and ajmalicine induced by NH4CI. There was a slow component to the efflux of ajmalicine which was not seen with vindoline, which could have been due to binding of the ajmalicine to either phenolics or counterions in the vacuole. In order to begin to extend the transport studies to the subcellular level, procedures were developed for the reliable isolation of vacuoles from mesophyll protoplasts. A combination of osmotic shock, followed by ultracentrifugation on step gradients of Ficoll was found to give a good yield of vacuoles with little contamination by non-vacuolar components. Binding of FITC-agglutinin (from Abrus precatorius) to the plasma membrane was found to give a rapid, semi-quantitative estimate of the contamination of the purified vacuoles by vacuoplasts. The plasma membrane and tonoplast ATPases were found on sucrose gradients at d=1.13-1.14 and d=1.105 respectively. No enrichment of either K+- stimulated or ionophore-stimulated pyrophosphatase activity could be found on sucrose gradients of the microsomal fraction. 0aCatharanthusxMetabolism. 0aIndole alkaloidsxSynthesis. 0aVinblastine. 0aVincristine. 4aMajor biochemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aScott, A.

It has been suggested, however, that the issue of gender in such studies may be confounded with one's relative position of strength, based on the belief that females assume a lower-status position in society than males. In the present series of studies, it was predicted that both gender and relative position of strength would influence power strategy use in undergraduate students who attempt to "get their way" with an imagined partner on choice of an academic project topic. In Study 1, the 2 X 2 MANOVA, with the independent variables being sex of actor and sex of target, was not significant. Univariate analyses revealed few significant findings in support of the hypothesis that gender influences power strategy use. In Study 2, the 2 X 2 MANOVA, with the independent variables being resources of actor and resources of target, was not significant. Univariate analyses revealed limited support for the hypothesis that relative position of strength influences power strategy use. In Study 3, the 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 MANOVA, with the independent variables being sex of actor, sex of target, resource level of actor, and resource level of target, was not significant. Univariate analyses revealed partial support for the hypothesis that gender and relative position of strength together influence power strategy use. Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients performed on data from all three studies revealed significant relationships between assertive behavior and power strategy use, and between self-concept and power strategy use. Lack of significant findings in the present study may be due in part to the artificial quality of the participants' task. Future studies should address this research question through the use of behavioral measures. 4aMajor psychology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStock, Wendy,edegree supervisor.1 aDavenport, Donna,edegree committee member.1 aFinlay, Barbara,edegree committee member.1 aSimpson, Jeffry,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941082641xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1530749zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745769601&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs423888ea-91e8-3fae-920b-7e874379b38aib77d0554-df7f-3ebe-8cf5-698a4df3415403804ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099002900201100002600230245008100256264001000337300002700347336002600374337002800400338002700428504004100455500001000496502004100506500003200547520179400579650003602373650002302409651003502432650001602467650002102483650004802504650004702552651004402599655002702643700004202670700004702712700004902759700004402808700005102852710005802903856007802961856015603039994001203195999007903207in0000120452620200904152632.0941116s1992    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31469140  9AGP2424AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31469140  ae-ur---  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaP5931 aPicht, James Whitney.10aStability and growth in centrally planned economies :btheory and evidence / 1c1992.  aix, 84 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The Soviet Union was seen as proof that central planning could take a backward peasant economy and transform it into a modern industrial power. Empiricists began to question these beliefs in the 1960s, but were hindered be the lack of reliable data. Studies performed in the 1980s demonstrated the existence of output and investment cycles in particular planned economies, but no comparisons were made with market-type economies. The relationship between investment and output in centrally planned economies was not explored. This dissertation presents a comparison of output stability in centrally planned and market-type economies. It uses data from the United Nations International Comparison Project which allow output to be compared across countries and across time. The results indicate that there was no statistically significant difference in output stability between the two types of economy. The analytical framework that predicts greater stability for centrally planned economies requires that investment be an important determinant of output; property rights approaches predict that output will determine investment. The relationship between investment and output is examined in this dissertation with two tests of causality, and it is found that investment does not determine output in centrally planned economies. In some cases output is found to weakly determine investment. The dissertation concludes with a comparison of mean growth rates in centrally planned and market-type economies. Again, no significant difference is found between the two groups. Possible reasons for this result are discussed. 0aCentral planningzSoviet Union. 0aMarxian economics. 0aSoviet UnionxEconomic policy. 0aCapitalism. 4aMajor economics. 7aCentral planning.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00850771 7aEconomic policy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00902025 7aSoviet Union.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210281 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMoroney, John R.,edegree supervisor.1 aHanson, John R.,edegree committee member.1 aBessler, David A.,edegree committee member.1 aReese, Roger,edegree committee member.1 aReynolds, Morgan O.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1448428zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746279501&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs8d6e883e-6c51-396a-be73-c29730f17e6fib813f349-3b93-34a4-a0ba-61883bb3dc5004303ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100003300217245005600250264001000306300004700316336002600363337002800389338002700417500002800444502004100472500001000513504004100523500003300564520253700597650003103134650002503165650003403190650002203224655002703246700004303273700004803316700005003364700004803414710005803462856007803520856015603598994001203754999007903766in0000107491820200904152559.0921001s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm26707979  9AFR7127AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)26707979  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaO971 aOwusu, John Cobbinah,d1954-12aA transformation technique for imaging offset VSP / 1c1991.  axiii, 149 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The transformed VSP is readily interpretable and easier to tie with surface seismic. A model-dependent transformation approach applicable to a general 2-D subsurface model has been developed. The transformation works by first determining a velocity-depth model consistent with the VSP data. Then using the model and raytracing we determine and relocate each primary event at its correct reflection point. The transformation generates both time and depth sections. The tune section generated from the depth model using the concept of image ray tracing. Since the transformation is basically an application of a moveout correction to the VSP traces), its effect is to distort the original waveform on the VSP trace and consequently smear the reflection event in both space and time. This smearing of the events degrades the lateral resolution of the transformation and therefore must be minimized by using optimum aquisition and processing parameters. An important step in the transformation procedure is the stacking of the moveout corrected traces at constant com m on reflection point (CRP) intervals. In this research the criteria for the determination of the optimum bin size is defined. The minimum bin size must be such that with in the zone of subsurface coverage there is at least one reflection point in each bin on each reflector. The maximum bin size must be such that the distortion across the bin is less than some acceptable value which depends on the objectives of the survey. The above criteria are particulary advantageous when stacking multi-offset VSP data. One of the main objectives of this research is to investigate the class of 2-D models for which the transformation is applicable. Time transformation is applicable to all classes of 2-D model for which the VSP time T is single-valued in the two-way timer and also the emergent image ray offset E is not multi-valued in r. Depth transformation is applicable to all classes of 2-D model for which the VSP time T is single-valued in the reflection depth Z and also the reflection offset X is not multivalued in Z. Since the transformation is model-dependent, it correctly transforms only those events whose dip, depth and velocity are included or interpolated from the model. All other events though not imaged perfectly, will be positioned in a manner that facilitates interpretation. The transformation was successfully tested on both synthetic and real VSP data. 0aSeismic reflection method. 0aSeismic prospecting. 0aTransformations (Mathematics) 4aMajor geophysics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aSpencer, Terry W.,edegree supervisor.1 aMorgan, Frank D.,edegree committee member.1 aPilant, Michael S.,edegree committee member.1 aWatkins, Joel S.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1250369zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744883201&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsc189b722-93b2-36dd-bc83-c878a3f5d43eib973e0ec-c2e1-36b3-bb9e-0114e8b2b7ec04172ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002600218245010500244264001000349300004600359336002600405337002800431338002700459500002800486502004100514500001000555504004100565500003100606520236400637650003903001650002403040650001403064650001703078650002003095655002703115700004003142700004703182700004503229700004503274710005803319856007803377856015603455994001203611999007903623in0000115509620200904152635.0930917s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm28841375  9AGC7623AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)28841375  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaS1631 aSalem, Claire Elayne.10aMethomyl-induced phytotoxicity in cotton (G̲o̲s̲s̲y̲p̲i̲u̲m̲ h̲i̲r̲s̲u̲t̲u̲m̲ L.) / 1c1992.  axiv, 184 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This study examined phytotoxicity of methomyl (S-methyl-N- [(methylcarbamoyl)oxy]-thioacetimidate) on cotton (Gossvpium hirsutum L.), with special reference to leaf spotting and photosynthetic activity. Three sets of experiments were performed. The objectives in the first set of experiments were 1) to establish the time courses of photosynthetic injury and leaf reddening and 2) to examine relationships between carbon exchange rate (CER), stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco) in leaves of methomyl-treated, field-grown cotton. In methomyl-treated leaves, CERs, stomatal conductance, rubisco, and chlorophyll fluorescence all decreased after spraying, but recovered to levels near to controls. The CERs were more closely related to stomatal conductance than to chlorophyll fluorescence or rubisco. Ethylene production is often associated with plant stress. The objective of the second set of experiments was to determine if ethylene is involved in methomyl-induced photosynthetic injury and leaf reddening. Cotton plants grown in environmentally controlled growth chambers were treated with 0, 2, 4, or 8 mM Ag (an ethylene action inhibitor). Three hours later, plants were sprayed with methomyl or a control spray. Silver treatment alleviated methomyl-induced decreases in CER, usually by hastening recovery, but occasionally by nearly eliminating injury. Once again, CERs were more strongly related to stomatal conductance than to chlorophyll fluorescence. Leaf spotting in methomyl-treated leaves was alleviated, but not eliminated, by Ag treatment. Various physiological and cultural considerations may affect severity of phytotoxicity. Thus, the objective of the third set of experiments was to determine effects of spray number, leaf position, and methomyl rate on methomyl-induced photosynthetic injury and leaf spotting of field-grown cotton. Percent spotting was greater in younger leaves than in older leaves. Whole-plot reddening was greater with two sprays than with one spray and greater at 0.84 kg ha^-1 methomyl than at 0.62 kg ha^-1. The only major differences in chlorophyll fluorescence and pigment concentrations were between methomyl-treated and non-methomyl-treated plots. 0aPlantsxEffect of insecticides on. 0aCottonxToxicology. 0aMethomyl. 0aPhytotoxins. 4aMajor agronomy. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aCothren, J.

The trials were instruments of revenge, and both Ney and La Bedoyere were apparently shot. However, legends exist stating that Ney escaped execution and lived in secret in the United States. This thesis presents for the first time trial accounts of Ney and La Bedoyere taken from a journal or diary of the period, and it also presents an historical context for the trials and an exploration of the legends surrounding Ney in America. 0aManuscriptsxCriticism, Textual.10aNey, Michel,cduc d'Elchingen,d1769-1815. 0aFrancexHistoryyRevolution, 1789-1799. 4aMajor English.27aRevolution (France : 1789-1799)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01354514 7aManuscripts.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01008230 7aFrance.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0120428917aNey, Michel.2swd07aProzess.2swd07aQuelle.2swd 7aGeschichte 18152swd 7a1789-17992fast 7aCriticism, interpretation, etc.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411635 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMeserole, Harrison T.,edegree supervisor.1 aBerthold, Dennis A.,edegree committee member.1 aBouton, Cynthia A.,edegree committee member.1 aRosenheim, James M.,edegree committee member.1 aVandiver, Frank E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1354092zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744686781&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsb7c25ec1-4f53-3b33-b286-f5323548ae7fibaa19b14-cd92-3497-889c-802a6e60dfe903350ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171100003700180245011000217264001000327300004800337336002600385337002800411338002700439504004100466500001000507502004100517500005200558520137800610650004101988655002702029700004602056700004902102700004502151700004702196710005802243856016902301856015602470856007802626856013302704994001202837999007902849in0000130076120200904152730.0960516s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34742341  9AHA3236AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34742341  aTXAM1 aJeyaseelan, Ranjit Singh,d1967-14aThe effect of processing additives on the wall slip of molten polyethylene /cby Ranjit Singh Jeyaseelan. 1c1994.  axviii, 145 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

A constitutive equation based on transient network theory, following the original formulation of Marrucci et al. (2 0 ), is able to adequately predict the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of these polymer melts in LAOS. Evaluating this constitutive equation to predict the shear stresses arising in LAOS with wall slip, using a previously proposed slip boundary condition (18), shows that this slip boundary condition is insufficient to predict the observed unstable stresses that arise in LAOS with wall slip. The critical strain amplitude at which unstable stresses arise in LAOS has been shown to correspond with the critical shear rate for the onset of melt fracture in extrusion, for untreated molten polymers. This observation can be used to develop a procedure to evaluate the melt fracture "potential" of polymer melts. Polymer processing additives are shown to have two distinct types of effects on the wall slip of molten polymers in LAOS. Two additives are shown to decrease the critical strain amplitude for the onset of unstable stresses in LAOS while another additive increases the critical strain amplitude. This suggests that there could be two mechanisms by which processing additives suppress melt fracture in extrusion. 4aMajor interdisciplinary engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGiacomin, A.

The rotating cavity has two plane disks and a cylindrical rim (shroud). The ratio of the rim span to the disk outer radius is 0.4 and the ratio of the disk inner radius to outer radius is 0.25. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of axial coolant flow rate, rotational speed, and disk surface temperature on the local heat transfer coefficient distributions inside the disk cavity. Six disk surface heating conditions (BC1, BC2, BC3, BC4, BC5 and BC6) were tested for the axial flow Reynolds numbers between 2500 and 25,000, the rotational Reynolds numbers between 0 and 5.11x10^5 and the rotational Grashof numbers between 1.8x10^6 and 2.2x10^10, respectively. The results showed that the disk cavity local heat transfer coefficients for the non-rotating cavity increase with increasing axial flow Reynolds number. However, the cavity local heat transfer coefficients decrease with increasing rotational Reynolds number and then increase with further increasing rotational Reynolds number. The downstream disk and rim generally have higher Nusselt numbers than the upstream disk. The Nusselt numbers on the upstream disk for BC 4, BC 5 and BC 6 are respectively lower than BC 1 and the Nusselt numbers on the downstream disk for BC 3, BC 5 and BC 6 are respectively lower than BC 1. However, the uneven disk temperature effect on the local Nusselt numbers decrease with decreasing axial Reynolds number and decrease with low rotational Reynolds number (Re[x] = 0 - 3.19x10^5), however, increase with high rotational Reynolds number (Re[x] = 5.11x10^5). The disk cavity Nusselt numbers for BC 1 and BC 2 are comparable. In general, the modified Nusselt numbers (NU[y]) on the upstream and downstream disks of this study and Farthing et al. (1990b) are lower than the flat verical wall natural convection correlations. The Nusselt numbers for Re[z] = 25,000 agree well with that of Farthing et al. (Re[z] = 2x10^4) except the present data are higher and lower, respectively, near the disk entrance (Gry = 1010) and near the rim (Gr[y] = 10^7). The averaged Nusselt numbers on the rim increase with increasing rotational Grashof numbers. However, the present rim data are lower than the natural convection correlation from the face down heated plate. 0aTurbomachinesxCooling. 0aHeatxTransmission. 0aDisks, RotatingxThermal properties. 4aMajor mechanical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHan, Je Chin,edegree supervisor.1 aAhmed, A.,edegree committee member.1 aAnand, N.

These are the most important compounds in the search for new porous materials. By controlling the gel chemistry, the interaction with the organic template, and reaction conditions the interesting compounds are separated from at least 3-5 other undesirable phases (dense phases or compound with small pore size). AIPO4-8 observed as a secondary phase in the different synthesis procedures to prepare H1, was obtained from a more viscous gel than the one used in the DPA system with all the other conditions similar to prepare HI. VPI-5 and H1 were found to be structurally similar but with some different physical properties, for example H1 was found thermally unstable with a phase transformation to AIPO[4]-8 at 100-300°C while VPI-5 was found stable at temperatures even higher than 650°C. The differences between these two compounds appear to be related to a structural aluminum excess in HI which represents weak structural sites where hydrolysis and or bond failure can occur with a ready transformation to AIPO[4]-8 . The solid state NMR on samples with different water contents demonstrated that bond breaking in dehydrated samples occurs as part of a strain mechanism relaxation. In both samples, H1 and VPI-5, the same phenomena is observed with some differences in the healing process when water is readsorbed, for example a more hydrophilic character is observed in HI. The strain relaxation is supported by an expansion in the c-axis and contraction of the a-axis as determined by the unit cell parameters of hydrated and dehydrated samples. Isomorphous elemental substitution in H1 and or VPI-5 is indicated to be promising for Si and Fe where about 10% of intended substitution is accepted into the framework by the reaction synthesis. Other metals such as Co, Mg, and Mn are supported to a lesser extent or direct the synthesis to other aluminophosphate phases. 0aPhosphatesxSynthesis. 0aAluminum compounds. 0aMolecular sieves. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aClearfield, Abraham,edegree supervisor.1 aLeoppert, Richard H.,edegree committee member.1 aVigh, Gyula,edegree committee member.1 aZingaro, Ralph A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1277000zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744883221&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsc60c95aa-7d8f-3de6-a42a-5ec7003744dbibd1b7361-1483-3e5e-90a0-f11dc5965fd302846ctm a2200445Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003800223245009800261264001000359300004600369336002600415337002800441338002700469504004100496500001000537502004100547500003300588520093100621650002601552650003101578650002201609655002701631700004401658700004501702700005201747700004901799710005801848856016901906856007802075856015602153994001202309999007902321in0000121711320200904152706.0950417s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32321143  9AGS1381AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32321143  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG6331 aGomez Meza, Marco Vinicio,d1954-10aEstimation of variance components and diagnostic analysis in unbalanced mixed linear models / 1c1993.  axiv, 178 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Without the non-negativity constraint, restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates are computed applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The approach used is to consider the unbalanced data as "incomplete data" and the conceptual set of n replications of each factor combination as the "complete data". An updated vector of "inputed values" is used at each iteration. This produces the generalized average (GAVE) method, which is a natural extension of the AVE method used for balanced data. The GAVE procedure takes into account the problem of empty cells while keeping the diagnostic properties of the AVE method. Numerical examples are included, which show the close relationship between AVE and GAVE algorithms, clarify these methodologies, and illustrate graphical diagnostic analysis. 0aAnalysis of variance. 0aLinear models (Statistics) 4aMajor statistics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHocking, Ronald R.,edegree supervisor.1 aDahm, Paul F.,edegree committee member.1 aGarcia-Diaz, Alberto,edegree committee member.1 aGates, Charles E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932872541xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1475138zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747687531&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs5c068036-3ef4-376b-bc3a-f562cd487229ic12d9d31-895b-3cc2-850c-3d936cd99ab704365ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099002800201100003000229245010100259264001000360300005100370336002600421337002800447338002700475504004100502500001000543502004100553500004500594520214900639650006202788650005302850650003102903650003402934650007302968650006403041650004203105651004503147655002703192700004603219700005003265700004803315700005103363700005003414710005803464856007803522856015603600994001203756999007903768in0000120452020200904152632.0941116s1992    xx ab    bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31469121  9AGP2417AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31469121  an-us---  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaO941 aOutlaw, Joe Layne,d1965-14aThe impacts of regional structural changes on the supply response of milk in the United States / 1c1992.  aix, 106 leaves :billustrations, maps ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

These structural shifts are exemplified by changes in regional location of production, as well as, disparate regional changes in the number and size of operations all of which have implications for milk supplies. As a result of these structural changes, the economic models used to forecast policy impacts on the dairy industry proved inaccurate. Traditionally, dairy supply models utilized long time series data to forecast milk production and thus their results may be dominated by trend variables rather than economic variables. There have been few analyses that incorporate the natural biological process of herd growth to determine future herd inventories and milk supply. Another, more important problem with previous modelling attempts has been the lack of attention given to the structural changes that have occurred in the dairy industry. The majority of the current milk supply models are aggregate or national models and are therefore incapable of providing detailed information about dairy industry changes. For example, there have not been any analyses providing information about replacement heifer movement from areas raising surplus replacement to deficit areas. This analysis developed a methodology that utilized biological information about herd dynamics to determine future daily herd size and milk supplies. Two models to predict future milk supply were developed using this methodology: an aggregate U.S. model and a regional model. Due to the limited amount of data, econometrics combined with optimal control was used to estimate values for unknown parameters in the models. Results from the regional model indicated that the Pacific, Upper Midwest, Corn Belt, Appalachian, and Northeast regions are net exporters of replacement heifers to other regions, while the Southern Plains and Southeast regions are net importers. The aggregate model tracked the historical trends better than the regional model in an ex post simulation and also provided more reasonable milk production forecasts. The regional model's forecasts were unacceptable. 0aDairy products industryxEconomic aspectszUnited States. 0aMilk supplyzUnited StatesxMathematical models. 0aMilk tradezUnited States. 4aMajor agricultural economics. 7aDairy products industryxEconomic aspects.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00887004 7aMilk supplyxMathematical models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01021707 7aMilk trade.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01021713 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aRichardson, James W.,edegree supervisor.1 aKnutson, Ronald D.,edegree committee member.1 aMjelde, James W.,edegree committee member.1 aPetersen, H.

Personnel with experience working in lesser developed countries on international training programs provided by U.S. petroleum companies were used as a sample to study the applicability of the American Society for Training and Development's 1983 role and competency model, Models for Excellence, to describe the work of training practitioners in lesser developed countries. The history and evolution of industrial training in the United States was traced from the early 1900s to the present understandings of trainer roles and competencies. Theories of culture were then reviewed to gain an appreciation of the complexities of cross-cultural transactions arid how these complexities might affect international training and education programs. Three models, Strategic Management, Instructional Systems Development, and the CIPP Evaluation model were examined for their utility in the integration of training as a strategic part of an international organization. A variety of quantitative and qualitative paradigms were considered to test for differences in the roles and competencies of trainers in domestic positions versus those working in lesser developed countries. A survey was conducted among experts in petroleum industry training in lesser developed countries using techniques similar to those of the Delphi method, attempting to replicate the Models for Excellence (ASTD, 1983) study. Numerical data collected were sorted using a three-dimensional spreadsheet program, while qualitative statements and data were transcribed and reported. The results of the research project confirmed the findings of the Models for Excellence (ASTD, 1983) study, and expanded the number of training and development practitioner roles to include four international roles not previously identified. These new roles were: 1. Cultural Interface Analyst 2. Organization Developer 3. Government Relations Facilitator 4. Technology Transfer Facilitator. 0aPetroleum industry and tradexEmployeesxTraining ofzDeveloping countries. 0aEmployee training directorsxRating of. 7aPetroleum industry and tradexEmployeesxTraining of.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01059574 7aDeveloping countries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01242969 4aMajor industrial education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBaker, Glenn E.,edegree supervisor.1 aChristiansen, James E.,edegree committee member.1 aHouseholder, Daniel L.,edegree committee member.1 aSchoenfeldt, Lyle F.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910696541xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1163166zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745137741&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsceda3153-a49c-305b-b43c-f2c3c590e038ic30ebf4f-4716-381c-8ed3-8129b7f4f1a203789ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002400197245009300221264001000314300004700324336002600371337002800397338002700425504004100452500001000493502004100503500005500544520213900599650004402738655002702782700004202809700004502851700004702896700005302943710005802996856007803054856015603132994001203288999007903300in0000126741020200904152718.0960307s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34326747  9AGX0298AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34326747  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaR1641 aRalston, Linda Sue.14aThe relationship between the expressed need for affiliation and motivations for travel / 1c1993.  axiii, 149 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Based on a review of the literature a conceptual model was proposed relating the need for affiliation and the motivation for travel. The primary objective of the study was to develop stable measurement instruments of the need for affiliation and travel motivations. This was accomplished through the use of a self-administered questionnaire administered with a convenience sample collected at four locations: (1) senior citizens living in an independent retirement community in Lee's Summit, Missouri; (2) senior citizens living in an independent retirement community in Salt Lake City, Utah; (3) students attending the REPK 301 classes at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas; and (4) students attending the RELE 192 classes at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah. The need for affiliation was measured by using the Mehrabian Affiliative Tendency Scales. Travel motivation was measured by using the Driver Recreation Experience Preference Scales for the domains of achievement, risk-taking, being with people, family togetherness, meeting-observing new people, learning-discovery, relationship with nature, reflecting on personal values, nostalgia, physical rest, escape personal-social pressures, and escape family. Type of traveler was measured using the Plog Psychocentric-Allocentric Scales. Information was obtained through a series of respondent profile and travel profile questions. The results of the study support Mehrabian's need for affiliation model and the need for affiliation and its relationship to affiliative and non-affiliative travel motivations model. All null hypotheses were rejected with the exception of the fourth null hypothesis, regarding international travel experience. With regard to the motivations for travel, there was a significant difference between sub-groups as determined by the need for affiliation, traveler type, travel experience, gender, marital status, and age with regard to the motivations for travel. 4aMajor recreation resources development. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHeath, Edward E.,edegree supervisor.1 aHodges, Louis,edegree committee member.1 aParasuraman, A.,edegree committee member.1 aVan Doren, Carlton S.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1520421zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744947221&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs71af180b-d975-3afb-8bb7-810b712d88b7ic40c8168-d5fb-3718-ad43-3b7be14fb17404387ctm a2200493Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040007000109024001700179035002000196049000900216099002900225100002000254245004700274264001000321300004500331336002600376337002800402338002700430500002800457502004100485500001000526504004100536500003200577520237100609650001802980650002102998650002603019650006003045650002103105655002703126700004603153700004803199700004703247700004703294710005803341856016903399856007803568856015603646994001203802999007903814in0000099578720200904152534.0901220s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22880385  9AEX9006AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdGBVCPdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCFdOCLCQdUMIdTXA8 aZBWT00418245  a(OCoLC)22880385  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS6981 aSong, Jong-Guk.10aOn the private provision of public goods / 1c1990.  aix, 119 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Basic analysis of private market provision of excludable public goods is needed in order to understand the implications of transfer of service responsibility from the public sector into the private sector. This thesis provides such an analysis. We first analyze the impact of differences in the characteristics of the demand preference distribution upon the profit maximizing choices of price and output by a private monopolist. We consider two alternative pricing strategies: maximum uniform pricing and optimum uniform pricing. We characterize changes in the heterogeneity of the market demand distributions by employing the concept of mean preserving spread distributions. In our second core chapter, we provide a comparison of public goods allocations under public monopoly and private monopoly. We develop a majority voting ranking of the two alternative modes. In particular, we extend the voting analysis found in Gronberg and Hwang to include a franchise tax. This franchise tax policy increases the probability that a majority of the consumer-votes will support private monopoly provision. We identify conditions under which privatization does gain majority support when government can extract some or all of the monopolist's profits and redistributes the profit to each consumer uniformly. Finally, we analyze provision of excludable public goods when they are subject to congestion effects. We again focus upon public monopoly and private monopoly as alternative institutional arrangements for allocating public goods. We define congestion in our model as average utilization, which is total utilization divided by the quantity consumed by each individual. In equilibrium, we find that the consumers will consume lower quality (more congested) public goods under a public regime than under a private monopoly provision regime. The voting results are very similar to the case of noncongestible public goods. Public provision, in general, still dominates private monopoly provision. Private monopoly provision does dominate public provision, however, when a franchise tax is introduced. The possibility of private monopoly provision domination increases when the congestion effects increase. 0aPublic goods. 0aFinance, Public. 0aGovernment marketing. 4aÖffentliches GutxPrivatwirtschaftxPolypolxTheorie. 4aMajor economics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGronberg, Timothy J.,edegree supervisor.1 aBaye, Michael R.,edegree committee member.1 aHwang, Hae-Shin,edegree committee member.1 aShafer, Carl E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:902727541xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1109076zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747120011&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffse5d5400e-f9ee-3b07-bbda-3af4139f3e46ic49c745d-fbd9-3731-a2db-a2d06f8692b203718ctm a2200433Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004900109035002000158084001800178049000900196099002900205100003200234245011100266264001000377300004700387336002600434337002800460338002700488504004100515500001000556502004100566500003200607520186300639650002102502655002702523700004302550700005002593700004202643700004702685710005802732856016902790856007802959856015603037994001203193999007903205in0000125982520200904152645.0960322s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34433257  9AGX3668AM  aTXAbengcTXAdDEBBGdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34433257  aLB 495292rvk  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaA3151 aAkubukwe, David Obi,d1938-13aAn analysis of community power structure and socioeconomic characteristics of leaders in Owerri, Nigeria / 1c1993.  axiii, 154 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The need to advance the study of community power structures in Nigerian communities is the principal stimulus for this study. There are several perceptions of community power. This study reviewed the two major theories of social power, the elitist and pluralist. It also examined the four dominant methods for the study of community power-- the positional, reputational, decisional and a combined approach. A combination of reputational and decisional methods was used in this study to locate the Owerri decision-makers or leaders and the key issues in which the leaders were involved. Four hypotheses are analyzed: (1) key decisional areas in Owerri within the last decade is small; (2) decision making in Owerri is elitist; (3) the key decision-makers fill positions in political and economic organizations; and (4) the characteristics of the decisional leaders are varied. Twelve informants and thirty-three leaders were interviewed. They mentioned a total of sixty-one leaders and three key issues-- the land, Eze and market issues. In the land and market issues, the Owerri leaders were on one side against the state government's propositions and actions while the leaders were divided on the Eze issue. There are some similarities and differences between the findings in the Owerri community power study and those of the communities studied in the United States. There is a need for social scientists both in Nigeria and Western countries that specialized in community studies to extend their researches to Nigerian communities to provide more bases for comparison between the Nigerian communities and communities in other countries. 4aMajor sociology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aSchaffer, Ruth C.,edegree supervisor.1 aMcIntosh, Wm.

Such descriptions call for an approach that should begin with an ethnographic investigation of the extralinguistic context and/or contexts within which those written language activities and practices actually take place. We must ground our models or theories in the real experience of real people. To do so, we: (1) need to learn about the repertoire of literate activities (2) need to learn about the cultural and socio-situational circumstances that surround those activities (3) need to learn about written language itself. This dissertation makes four general contributions to generating sound models or theories of literacy or written language learning and use. 1) It proposes an understanding of literacy that allows us to ground our initial investigations of written language learning and use in the real experience of real people. 2) It offers a preliminary descriptive taxonomy of literate activities. 3) It suggests that within a single context or within a particular discourse community, there are different ways of reading and writing. 4) It lays the foundation for future research into the varieties of written language. Once we begin to explore what we do when we learn and use written language, how and why some of us learn and use written language in ways different from others, we will then also begin to explain the meaning of written language in human life. 0aLiteracyzUnited States. 0aSociolinguisticszUnited States. 0aAnthropological linguisticszUnited States. 4aMajor English. 7aAnthropological linguistics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00810178 7aLiteracy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00999859 7aSociolinguistics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01123847 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBailey, Guy,edegree supervisor.1 aBusby, Mark,edegree committee member.1 aGong, Gwendolyn,edegree committee member.1 aIvie, Robert L.,edegree committee member.1 aJohnstone, Barbara,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1274330zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744871441&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs20bd83fb-00e4-35c5-818f-9a79fdb66324ic6905827-25c2-3d62-accf-9ab0e5cfc69004199ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003100218245013700249264001000386300004700396336002600443337002800469338002700497504004100524500001000565502004100575500003700616520231300653650004802966650004503014650003103059650002403090650002603114655002703140700004103167700005003208700004803258700005203306710005803358856007803416856015603494994001203650999007903662in0000120299820200904152637.0941031s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31383937  9AGM7663AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)31383937  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaS4251 aScott, Brett David,d1962-10aEfficacy of a fat-supplemented diet to maintain muscle glycogen stores and reduce thermal stress in exercising Thoroughbred horses / 1c1992.  axiii, 127 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Twelve mature Thoroughbred horses were used to evaluate the efficacy of a fat-supplemented diet to maintain muscle glycogen stores and reduce thermal stress in exercising horses. In this study, exercising Thoroughbred horses were maintained in three body conditions (moderately low--condition score 4, moderate--condition score 5, and moderately high--condition score 6) and fed experimental diets containing similar nutrient-to-calorie ratios. The diets were (1) control (no added fat) and (2) 10% added fat. The horses performed standard exercise tests during which muscle biopsies were obtained from the biceps femoris. The muscle biopsies were utilized to determine muscle glycogen concentrations. Pre-test muscle glycogen concentrations were similar (P >.05) for horses in ML, M and MH condition groups. When the horses were fed the fat-supplemented diet, the comparable pre-test muscle glycogen concentrations were higher (P <.05) averaging 21.07, 26.06 and 24.42 mg/g, which was a 30%, 55% and 31%, increase, respectively, in resting muscle glycogen concentrations. Post-test muscle glycogen concentrations were similar (P >.05) for horses on all treatments. Trial II. Eight of the original Thoroughbreds, four males and four females were randomly divided into two groups of four with equal number of males and females. Following a pre-trial adjustment period, four horses from each treatment group were fed a control diet and the other four horses were fed a fat-supplemented diet. After the experimental period, a SET and energy balance trial was conducted. Upon completion of the energy balance trial, the horses were switched to the other diet. Again, a SET and energy balance trial were conducted. While consuming the fat-supplemented concentrate, horses had significantly lower (P <.01) total heat production. This reduction in total heat production resulted in a significant increase (P <.05) in available net energy for work for horses consuming the fat-supplemented concentrate. The heat increment of the fat-supplemented concentrate was significantly lower (P <.01) than the heat increment associated with the control diet. Thus, a significantly greater (P <.05) percentage of the net energy available in the horses consuming the fat-supplemented concentrate was available for work. 0aGlycogenxMetabolismxPhysiological effect. 0aHorsesxExercisexPhysiological aspects. 0aHorsesxFeeding and feeds. 0aThoroughbred horse. 4aMajor animal science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPotter, Gary D.,edegree supervisor.1 aAnderson, James G.,edegree committee member.1 aGreene, L.

It seeks to determine whether United Kingdom firms are taking advantage of accounting standards pertaining to goodwill to acquire attractive United States targets. A probit model is employed in the study to determine if there is a difference in the goodwill amounts paid by the United States and United Kingdom acquirers and in the financial characteristics of the firms they acquire. The financial ratios chosen for this study have been used extensively in prior literature to predict acquisition targets. A sample of 153 acquired firms (126 United States and 27 United Kingdom) which were acquired between 1986-1989 is analyzed. The sample is tested using data from the year prior to the acquisition as well as an average of three years prior to the acquisition, and financial ratios are deflated by industry averages to try and minimize an effect of industry differences. The conclusions of the analysis are quite interesting. In the short and long-run univariate analysis the goodwill, profitability, price-earnings and liquidity variables all proved to be significantly different when the United States and United Kingdom firms were compared. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the goodwill, profitability, valuation and liquidity variables were significantly different in either the short or long-run models when the two subsamples were compared. 0aConsolidation and merger of corporations. 0aInvestments, AmericanzGreat Britain. 0aAccounting. 4aMajor accounting. 7aInvestments, American.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978314 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStrawser, Robert,edegree supervisor.1 aFuerst, William,edegree committee member.1 aGrossman, Steven,edegree committee member.1 aRinger, Larry,edegree committee member.1 aShearon, Winston,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1381621zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745945631&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs17bc7dfe-26aa-3c9f-908d-d0ebb2a541cdic9309241-9f84-3d13-a825-809ae4ac3a5102397ctm a2200433Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002600197245008500223264001000308300002700318336002600345337002800371338002700399504004100426500001000467502004100477500004000518520070100558650002901259655002701288700004201315700004701357700004101404700004301445700004801488700004401536710005801580856007801638856015601716994001201872999007901884in0000127214820200904152648.0960222s1993    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34242662  9AGW7850AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34242662  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaA5531 aAndrade, Lydia Maria.10aPositions of power :binitiating the relationship between legislators and pacs / 1c1993.  av, 209 leaves ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The literature in the business field posits the opposite; that it is in fact the legislators who pursue PACs and their contributions. The purpose of this dissertation is to reconcile these conflicting views. Responses to surveys by PAC officials, former and current members of Congress are compared to triangulate on the true direction of the relationship. Considered were also the various organizational differences which may account for the ability and/or likelihood of PACs to be solicited by candidates. 4aMajor political science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aWiggins, Charles,edegree supervisor.1 aAnderson, James,edegree committee member.1 aBond, Jon,edegree committee member.1 aHamm, Keith,edegree committee member.1 aHurley, Patricia,edegree committee member.1 aKeim, Gerald,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1518247zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744719861&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs803cc38f-f317-3c23-ab6e-3e99c087a4f9ic9738a86-d8b4-367e-8348-2753bc69783003600ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005800109035002000167043001200187049000900199099002900208100003400237245010000271264001000371300004500381336002600426337002800452338002700480500002800507502004100535500001000576504004100586500003600627520153400663650003002197650003202227650002102259650002502280650004002305650004902345650005102394651003702445655002702482700004302509700005102552700004902603700004702652710005802699856007802757856015602835994001202991999007903003in0000117296620200904152617.0940119s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm29648943  9AGE5993AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)29648943  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaD4411 aDesai, Anjana Naynesh,d1959-10aInterception of precipitation by mesquite dominated rangelands in the rolling plains of Texas / 1c1992.  aix, 101 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This ranch is located 22 km north of Throckmorton, Texas. The objective was to develop an in-depth understanding and predictive capability of the rainfall interception process. Canopy and foliar area of the sample trees were obtained using 35 mm slides and video images. An image of each sample tree was captured and analyzed by the computer software. The effect of storm and plant variables on the process of interception was analyzed by applying statistical procedures. Regression models were developed and the Gash model validated. The results of the study indicate that 80.9% of the rainfall was in the form of throughfall while 2.8% was in the form of stemflow. Application of stepwise regression determined that rainfall was the major factor contributing to the variation in throughfall (r^2 = 0.98) and stemflow (r^2 =0.71), followed by season, duration and intensity. Among the climatic factors affecting the interception process no significant difference for throughfall or stemflow was attributable to season, duration, intensity, nor to vegetation factors like canopy density, total tree height or stem circumference. Storm size was the principal determinant of throughfall and stemflow. Finally, the amount of rainfall not available to mesquite due to the interception process was calculated to be 16.3%. 0aRain and rainfallzTexas. 0aRangeland hydrologyzTexas. 0aMesquitezTexas. 4aMajor range science. 7aMesquite.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01017382 7aRain and rainfall.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01089410 7aRangeland hydrology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01715753 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKnight, Robert W.,edegree supervisor.1 aKothmann, Merwyn M.,edegree committee member.1 aWolfe, Mary Leigh,edegree committee member.1 aWurbs, Ralph A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1365918zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744912781&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs015f93fc-8e62-3add-a746-7a82b9b2a81eicad2e2d6-dac0-313c-80e5-d1d37bc60c5103688ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099003200194100003600226245007500262264001000337300004400347336002600391337002800417338002700445500002800472502004100500500001000541504004100551500004500592520173000637650003802367650003302405650003402438655002702472700003902499700004802538700004502586700004702631710005802678856016902736856007802905856015602983994001203139999007903151in0000093455420200904152433.0901023s1989    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22572739  9AER2833AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)22572739  aTXAM  a1989aDisser-atationaA3241 aAlavi-Sereshki, Mohammad Mehdi.10aImproved techniques for reliability evaluation of generation systems / 1c1989.  axi, 75 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

These techniques are based on Fourier transforms and their properties. They permit the use of continuous probability distribution(s) for the probability distribution resulting from the sum of discrete random variables, where each variable is statistically independent of others. It is shown that the well-known Gram-Charlier's expansion is a special case of the first technique. Using the first technique, any continuous distribution can be examined for its suitability for modeling the distribution of the sum of discrete random variables. Using the second technique, a group of continuous distributions can be examined for their suitability for modeling the distribution of the sum of discrete random variables. The aggregate distribution for the generation capacity in a power system is traditionally derived by taking the distribution of a generating unit and combining with it the distribution of another unit until all distributions are processed. Although a recursive algorithm is available for this purpose, the process is computationally very costly. Numerous attempts have been made in the last two decades to develop a continuous distribution for this purpose. Presently, the most widely used continuous technique is the cumulant method, which is most commonly expressed in Gram-Charlier's expansion. Nevertheless, the results are not quite satisfactory. In this dissertation, gamma distribution, specifically that with three parameters, is inserted in the new techniques for evaluating the generation capacity reliability and it is shown that this approach provides superior results than any other methods presently used. 0aDistribution (Probability theory) 0aProbabilistic number theory. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aSingh, Chanan,edegree supervisor.1 aPainter, John H.,edegree committee member.1 aParish, T.

Adsorption studies were carried out in wide pressure and temperature ranges of 10^-7-10^1 Torr and 90-1000K, respectively, employing techniques of RAIRS and TPD. The adsorption of CO on Pd(111) was found to be very sensitive for the preparation conditions of the adsorbed CO layer. In contrast, no effect of preparation conditions was seen on the adsorption of CO on Pd(100). By carrying out CO adsorption measurements under isobaric conditions, isosteric heats of adsorption were determined for Pd(111), Pd(100) and Cu/Rh(100) as a function of CO coverage. Discontinuities in the isobaric plots were observed in the range of the phase transition of adsorbed CO layers due to the different IR absorption cross sections of CO molecules in different adsorption positions. For Pd(111) an equilibrium phase diagram was constructed which shows the continuity of CO adsorption phases with increasing CO pressure and surface temperature. Excellent agreement was found between IR spectra of equilibrated CO layers on Pd(111) and Pd(100) single crystals and a Pd/SiO2 catalyst which suggests that the small metal particles on a support have crystal faces with mostly (111) and (100) orientations. Results of elevated pressure kinetic and IR measurements for the oxidation of CO on Pd(111) and Pd(100) strongly support the generally accepted correspondence between the heat of CO adsorption and the activation energy. Therefore, we believe that as far as the adsorption of CO is structure sensitive, the oxidation of carbon monoxide is structure sensitive, as well. Deposition of Cu on the Rh(100) surface results in an increase in catalytic activity for CO oxidation. Maximum activity is seen at θ[Cu]=1.3ML and the activity of Cu/Rh(100) catalysts are higher than that of Rh(100) even at θ[Cu]>3ML...41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747871331&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs1957532d-25d5-36ae-b29d-9f8a7db510ddicc435352-584f-340e-9997-4abefb4144dc04360ctm a2200529Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003800218245011300256264001000369300004700379336002600426337002800452338002700480500002800507502004100535500001000576504004100586500005000627520224300677650001602920650002102936650001802957650001202975650004202987650004703029650003803076650004403114650003203158655002703190700004403217700004203261700004503303700005003348700004903398710005803447856007803505856015603583994001203739999007903751in0000104294920200904152500.0910812s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24221207  9AFG7457AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)24221207  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaA4471 aAlmeida Dominguez, Helbert David.10aProduction of weaning food from composites of pearl millet and cowpea /cby Helbert David Almeida Dominguez. 1c1990.  axiii, 147 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Sorghum malt was added to the composites to produce drinkable weaning foods. Millet was decorticated and then extruded at several moisture levels. Decortication of millet caused increased starch content and in vitro protein digestibility and decreased protein, lysine, threonine and histidine contents and C-PER. Extrusion at 15% moisture of decorticated (76% yield) millet produced the highest radial expansion, water solubility index and cold viscosity. Extrusion increased the water absorption (WAI) and solubility (WSI) indices, enzyme susceptible starch (ESS) and in vitro protein digestibility of millet. Highly expanded millet extrudate has potential for production of baby foods, snacks or breakfast cereals. Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) was used to test the sorghum malt quality and liquefying power on precooked flour. Maximum diastatic activity occurred in sorghum germinated for 3-4 days. In vitro protein digestibility, lysine content and C-PER increased during germination. Sorghum malt was able to liquefy precooked rice or millet pastes within 5 min at 30°C. The RVA adequately measured diastatic activity in a relatively short time using small malt samples. Decorticated millet flour was heated in water and pressed against a hot griddle (press-drying) to produce dry flakes. WAI, WSI and ESS of decorticated millet flour increased after press-drying. This flour had adequate paste property for weaning food preparation. Dehulled cowpea was boiled, ground and press-dried. Press-drying increased the WAI and decreased the WSI of cowpea. Weaning food from extruded or press-dried millet flour (70%) and press-dried cowpea flour (30%) formed smooth pastes after mixing with cold water. Treatment with 5% sorghum malt produced drinkable foods. All experimental and commercial composites had ESS values of >85%. The composites had >17% protein content and >90% of the essential amino acids of the FAO/WHO protein pattern for children less than 1 yr old. Press-drying may have potential in developing countries for production of weaning food with acceptable viscosity and nutritional properties from cereal/grain legume blends. 0aBaby foods. 0aCereal products. 0aPearl millet. 0aCowpea. 7aBaby foods.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00825000 7aCereal products.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00851221 7aCowpea.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00882018 7aPearl millet.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01056098 4aFood Science and Technology 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aRichter, Ronald L.,edegree supervisor.1 aRooney, Lloyd W.,edegree supervisor.1 aLusas, Edmund,edegree committee member.1 aRichter, Ronald L.,edegree committee member.1 aWaniska, Ralph D.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1190509zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746170681&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2f45c83b-e4d4-313e-8776-f583d0a9e053icc74668f-24a4-3162-bab1-ab7a3a1f3e4704054ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003200218245008800250264001000338300004600348336002600394337002800420338002700448504004100475500001000516502004100526500004400567520213500611650004702746650003102793650004502824650002602869650005302895650003302948655002702981700004403008700004803052700005003100700005103150710005803201856007803259856015603337994001203493999007903505in0000120408620200904152629.0941114s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31450625  9AGP1929AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31450625  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaM5471 aMenon, Ramesh Gopal,d1962-10aConcurrent simulation and constraint stabilization for flexible multibody systems / 1c1992.  axii, 135 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Non-recursive order N formulations for the transient dynamic analysis of multibody systems can be achieved using range space methods. Unlike the recursive methods, this formulation does not rely on system topology to induce parallelism. These methods induce concurrency via the method of subdomain decomposition, and it is shown that they are amenable to implementation on the forthcoming class of highly parallel architectures. This class of formulations can be distinguished from other variants of sub-domain decomposition in that redundant degrees of freedom are retained, and the coupling of substructures is achieved by explicitly calculating the coupling forces in an order N computational cost. A preconditioned conjugate gradient method is used for the range space solution, with a preconditioner motivated by the directed graph of multibody systems with no closed chains. The method is shown to be rapidly convergent for linear and nonlinear structural systems with a large number of degrees of freedom. One potential drawback of the range space formulation is the well known constraint violation drift associated with redundant formulations of transient multibody dynamics. This dissertation introduces a family of concurrent constraint violation stabilization algorithms that retain the order N computational cost of the range space formulation, while ensuring simulation fidelity. The hybrid methods introduced are based upon penalty multibody formulations and augmented Lagrangian formulations. Explicit bounds on measures of the constraint violation are presented. It is shown that, in the augmented Lagrangian method, the number of fixed iterations per time step dictate the diameters of the attractors of constraint violations in phase space. Several numerical examples of simulation and control are presented including simulations of the Space Station Freedom, the NASA Langley Control Structure Interaction Evolutionary model and nonlinear, multi-rigid bodies articulating in space. 0aParallel processing (Electronic computers) 0aDynamicsxData processing. 0aMachinery, Dynamics ofxData processing. 0aLagrangian functions. 0aLarge space structures (Astronautics)xDynamics. 4aMajor aerospace engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKurdila, Andrew J.,edegree supervisor.1 aJunkins, John L.,edegree committee member.1 aPilant, Michael S.,edegree committee member.1 aVadali, Srinivas R.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1447985zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746519951&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs028ff731-f16b-3f6a-aca0-097b2c4ba658icdb4592b-6674-37ee-b717-1de5ae592c4604704ctm a2200565Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165043001200185049000900197099003200206100004500238245014400283264001000427300004600437336002600483337002800509338002700537500002800564500005500592502004100647500001000688504004100698500003500739650001600774650003900790650003800829650005400867650004300921650005600964651005201020650002401072648004101096655002701137700004101164700005001205700005001255700004601305700005001351710005801401856016901459856007701628520218601705856015603891994001204047999007904059in0000086999820200904152433.0900126s1989    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm20962799  9AEK3186AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)20962799  als-----  aTXAM  a1989aDisser-atationaA3461 aAlcala-Herrera, Javier Alejandro,d1953-10aCoccoliths from the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary of the Walvis Ridge, South Atlantic :bbiostratigraphic and paleoecological implications / 1c1989.  axiv, 195 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  aPart of illustrative matter folded in back pocket.  bPh.

Biostratigraphy and diversity determinations were made on 177 samples and stable isotope ratios for oxygen and carbon were measured on the coccolith fraction of 140 samples. The interval examined extends from the Maastrichtian Reinhardtites levis Zone (74.5 m.y.) to the Paleocene Discoaster mohleri Zone (60.6 m.y.). A drastic change in δ[^13]C ratios (1.4[ppt]) was recorded at Site 525A in a 1.62 m interval across the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary that was not sampled. A more gradual decrease in signals occurs at Sites 527, 528, and 529, where more closely spaced samples were analyzed. The gradual decrease in δ[^13]C values above the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary is related to the progressive decrease of the proportion of deposited Cretaceous species in the sample. The decrease in the δ[^13]C signal across the boundary is interpreted as a decrease in primary productivity. Evaluation of the shift of δ[^13]C values in relation to the proportion of redeposited species in early Tertiary samples at Sites 527 and 529 indicates that Cretaceous species did not survived into the Paleocene. Diversity calculated using the Shannon-Weaver equation decreased by 1.8 at Site 525A which is the shallowest location. The average decrease at Sites 527, 528, and 529 was 1.1. These decreases reflect the massive plankton extinctions at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. The carbon isotope and diversity curves correlate across the Cretaceous-Tertiary transition. Diversity recovered in approximately 1.6 m.y.; however, the δ[^13]C signal recovered only some 5 m.y. after the boundary event and, thus lagged biotic recovery by a significant length of time. The paleontological record at the four Walvis Ridge sites indicates that the nannoflora does not record any significant stress or event preceding the massive extinction at the boundary, where the calcareous nannoplankton show an almost total and instant extinction...41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747308531&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6c520798-9046-3d27-9a47-1a1631b48033icec1f9c0-96c7-3516-848a-528481c3579f04393ctm a2200505Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172043001200192049000900204099002900213100003400242245012000276264001000396300004600406336002600452337002800478338002700506500002800533502004100561500001000602504004100612500003500653520219400688650004902882650002202931650004002953650006102993651004403054650002403098655002703122700004203149700004803191700005003239700004603289710005803335856016903393856007803562856015603640994001203796999007903808in0000107325120200904152539.0920227s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm25353732  9AFP3076AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)25353732  aa-su---  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaA4511 aAl-Mofeez, Ibraheem Abdullah.10aInsulation in the opaque envelope :beffects on thermal performance of residential buildings in hot-arid climates / 1c1991.  axiv, 155 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The study emphasized the effect on cooling load. Three room-sized buildings were used in the field experiment. All buildings were identical in size, color, orientation, and openings. One building was externally insulated, one was internally insulated, and one was uninsulated. The experiment was conducted in the hot-arid climate of Saudi Arabia. Descriptive, inferential, and implication analyses were compared. The descriptive analyses included the black globe temperature (BGT) daily profile plot. The inferential analyses included general linear model (GLM) procedures and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) pairwise comparisons of the BGT means, maximums, minimums, and ranges. The results of BGT analyses were used in an energy simulation program to assess the implications of the results on annual energy consumption and on the sizing of HVAC systems. Results from these analyses indicated significant differences in the average of maximums, ranges, and overall means of the BGT among the three buildings. There were no significant differences at the 95% confidence level in the average of minimums among the three buildings. Findings strongly support the first three hypotheses which were about the BGT means, maximums, and ranges. The implications of the BGT results were found to be within expectations. The annual energy consumption and the size of HVAC equipment were the lowest in the externally insulated house. The cost benefit analysis indicated substantial savings for households; the simple payback period was less than three years. Some of the design recommendations for building in hot-arid climates emphasized the protection of external insulation from impact forces and other environmental effects such as ultraviolet rays. External insulation should be used in buildings with continuous use and continuous air conditioning. More thermal benefits may be attained when external insulation is utilized with night ventilation, although the ventilation aspects had not been studied conclusively here. 0aBuildingsxEnergy consumptionzSaudi Arabia. 0aInsulation (Heat) 0aExterior wallsxThermal properties. 7aBuildingsxEnergy consumption.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00841049 7aSaudi Arabia.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210372 4aMajor architecture. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aReed, Raymond D.,edegree supervisor.1 aBoyer, Lester L.,edegree committee member.1 aDegelman, Larry O.,edegree committee member.1 aO'Neal, Dennis,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913390341xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1229767zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747391441&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsce8c7153-192a-3f0a-a513-a3a84ec47540icfb31f96-64a0-31ef-a996-e78265af48a203327ctm a2200493Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005800109035002000167043001200187050002600199049000900225099002900234100003200263245018100295264001000476300004700486336002600533337002800559338002700587500002800614502004100642500001000683504004100693500003500734520125600769650004802025650003802073650002402111650006002135651004402195655002702239700004202266700004802308700004702356700004702403710005802450856007802508856015602586994001202742999007902754in0000111671920200904152610.0930312s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27720585  9AFV4811AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)27720585  aa-su--- 4aNA4346.S22bR52 1992a  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaA4611 aAl-Saleem, Yousef Abdullah.10aEvaluating the performance of government office buildings from the users' perspective :ba case study of the ministry of foreign affairs headquarters building in Saudi Arabia / 1c1992.  axiii, 176 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The purpose of this study is to present a systematic approach to evaluate buildings designed for use in Saudi Arabia. A conceptual model is presented to evaluators as a guide in collecting and analyzing data on office environments. A number of relationships suggested by that model have been examined using data from a case study of a new government office building in Saudi Arabia. Findings show that private offices are viewed more favorably by people occupying them than by workers in other types of offices. The aesthetic quality of the work space is the most important factor associated with work station satisfaction even after taking into account the workers' ratings of specific work space attributes. It also demonstrates that people's feeling about the ambience of a setting within which they work and the architecture of the building influence their reaction to the immediate work space. It is suggested that space planners and designers who want their work to be appreciated by the users should concern themselves with the details of work space as well as with the larger scale environment. 0aPublic buildingszSaudi ArabiaxEvaluation. 0aArchitectural designxEvaluation. 4aMajor architecture. 7aPublic buildingsxEvaluation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01082123 7aSaudi Arabia.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210372 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aReed, Raymond D.,edegree supervisor.1 aBerke, Philip R.,edegree committee member.1 aFinlay, Barbara,edegree committee member.1 aMann, George J.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1281165zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747448181&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2a504aaa-0a93-338e-8f24-2d56899f8e7cid0ab0763-2ce4-321c-b219-92f9ad27e4f504440ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099003200180100003500212245010500247264001000352300004600362336002600408337002800434338002700462500002800489502004100517500001000558504004100568500003200609520243100641650004103072650004403113650003303157650002103190655002703211700004003238700004403278700004703322700004903369710005803418856016903476856007803645856015603723994001203879999007903891in0000090198320200904152433.0900629s1989    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm21947766  9AEN0307AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)21947766  aTXAM  a1989aDisser-atationaA2241 aAddiego, William Peter,d1956-10aCharacterization of active sites and the effect of reduction and metal promoters on iron catalysts / 1c1989.  axvi, 231 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide were used as probe molecules to observe the effects of reduction and metal promoters (i.e., potassium and copper) on iron adsorption sites. The resulting frequencies of the adsorbed molecules were correlated with the types of sites on the surface, and the nature of probe interaction with the surface. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were complementary methods used to establish the extent of reduction and the valence state of iron after calcination and reduction treatments. Calcination (300°C) of silica-supported iron catalysts generates Fe[^2+] sites, whether or not the catalyst is heat-treated in vacuum or cooled in oxygen. High-temperature (730°C) heat-treatment in vacuum forms a surface-reduced phase which generates cationic sites similar to those found on silica-influenced Fe3O4, in addition to non-interacting iron oxide. Reduction generates Fe[^0] sites, but overall reduction is incomplete. NO adsorption on metallic iron occurs associatively and dissociatively, oxidizing Fe[^0]. Subsequent NO adsorption generates bands associated with dinitrosyl species and a bent mononitrosyl species on low-coordination sites. CO adsorbs on calcined, unpromoted catalysts and reacts with surface oxygen to form carbonates. On reduced catalysts, CO adsorbs as a monocarbonyl on Fe[^0] sites and also dissociatively adsorbs, inhibiting NO adsorption on metallic iron, and blocking NO adsorption on high-coordination oxide sites. CO dissociation appears to be dependent on CO pressure and is inhibited by the presence of copper. Copper increases the extent of iron reduction in hydrogen. The amount of metal dispersion increases with copper content. Bulk reduction is about the same as that of the unpromoted silica-supported catalyst. Copper modifies NO adsorption on calcined and reduced catalysts. Potassium provides electron density to iron nitrosyl species associated with Fe[^2+] sites, causing frequency decreases from those which occur on the unpromoted catalyst.

The presence of such constraints causes the closed-loop DMC system to behave nonlinearly even if the plant dynamics axe linear. Consequently, well known linear control theory is not sufficient to analyze the stability properties of such a system. The analysis is even further complicated by the facts that no analytic expression is available for the DMC controller and uncertainty always exists in the process model. Present design techniques of DMC controllers rely on experience or ad hoc solutions, without closed-loop stability guarantees. Widespread usage of DMC controllers in industry makes the development of a controller design theory a formidable problem whose solution is of great practical importance. In this work, we provide a theory which utilizes the basic dynamic programming principles to analyze and design DMC controllers in the presence of disturbances, process input/output constraints, and modeling error. The key point of the theory is the modification of the classical DMC formulation by including an extra constraint which we called end-condition. Simulation results verify the theory's predictions. 0aPredictive control. 0aChemical process control. 0aProcess controlxMathematical models. 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aNikolaou, Michael,edegree supervisor.1 aDurbin, Leo D.,edegree committee member.1 aParlos, Alexander G.,edegree committee member.1 aWatson, A.

More specifically, this study: (a) established the personality profile of an ultra-distance runner, (b) compared the personality characteristics of runners who finished in the first and last 33% of all selected races, (c) compared the personality characteristics of ultra-distance and recreational runners, and (d) compared the personality characteristics of ultra-distance runners to those of the general population. Two hundred forty-six participants in four ultra-distance races volunteered as subjects for the study. Seventy-six recreational runners used for the study were students enrolled in intermediate aerobic running activity courses at Texas A&M University during the 1992 spring semester. Statistical analysis indicated the following: (a) ultra-distance runners who finished in the first 33% of races were more inclined to experiment in life generally, and more tolerant of inconvenience and change; (b) ultra-distance runners who finished in the last 33% of races had strong control of their emotions and general behavior; (c) ultra-distance runners were more intelligent, more emotionally stable, more conscientious, more imaginative, more socially aware, more self-sufficient, and more compulsive than recreational runners; (d) recreational runners were more dominant, more enthusiastic, more suspicious, and more tense than ultra-distance runners; (e) ultra-distance runners were more dominant, more venturesome, more experimenting, more self-sufficient, and more tense than the general population; and (f) the general population was more social than ultra-distance runners. 0aRunningxPsychological aspects. 0aSportsxPsychological aspects. 0aMarathon running. 0aRunners (Sports)xPsychology. 4aMajor kinesiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aChevretteee supervisor.1 aChevrette, John M.,edegree supervisor.1 aGahbard, Carl P.,edegree committee member.1 aKaiser, Ronald A.,edegree committee member.1 aPender, Robert H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1433840zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746279521&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs44e8ed4b-cf64-3925-97de-4d105dc367acid275aabc-17cf-38a1-9d6f-20cc6a593c1803856ctm a2200433Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100002200218245008900240264001000329300004300339336002600382337002800408338002700436500002800463502005500491500001000546504005600556500003700612520213400649650002302783650001902806655002702825700004602852700005202898700004802950700004202998710005803040856007703098856015603175994001203331999007903343in0000040652720190325091557.0860409s1984    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm13410053  9ABS9504AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdTXA  a(OCoLC)13410053  aTXAM  a1984aDissertationaM7451 aMonk, Roger Lynn.12aA characterization of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Moench) is often considered a viable potential resource. Plant breeding efforts to improve sorghum are limited in part by a poor definition of quality traits and their inheritance. To address these concerns, six diverse sorghums were compared and then combined to produce a full F(,1) diallel with reciprocal crosses for genetic analysis. Fourteen agronomic, composition or quality traits were measured using chemical, biological and microscopic techniques. The six parental genotypes were grown at College Station and Weslaco, Texas in 1982 and 1983 while the diallel was grown at College Station in 1983. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, correlation and the Jinks-Hayman methods of diallel analysis. A significant genotype x environment interaction occurred for Brix % and yield per plant, but height and maturity did not display a significant effect. Among the traits evaluated, Brix % and total sugars were highly positively correlated and total sugars and cell wall % were highly negatively correlated. Structural components, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose comprised between 50 to 65% of the total carbohydrate and as such indicate that utilization schemes must use these fractions. IVDMD was not highly correlated with any of the traits evaluated nor did the microscope measurements correlate in a useful manner. Through the diallel analysis, it was determined that additive genetic variance was a significant factor for total sugars, cell wall %, IVDMD, hemicellulose and starch. However, partial dominance was indicated for several traits as well. Reciprocal effects were not a major factor for the traits evaluated. Heritability estimates ranged from a high of 88% for starch to almost zero for lignin; with total sugars, IVDMD and starch being the only traits with heritabilities greater than 35%. The results together indicate that a breeding program should continue to develop improved male and female lines for use in hybrids. 0aSorghumxGenetics. 4aPlant Breeding 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMiller, Frederick R.,edegree supervisor.1 aCreelman, Richard A.,edegree committee member.1 aMcBee, George G.,edegree committee member.1 aSoltes, Ed,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/Dissertations-408578zLink to OAKTrust Copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=752194741&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to ProQuest Copy  aC0bTXAffs24da6e73-61b7-37c9-8ba4-60215f3dd423id40a76e5-6f7b-3f77-8fc5-8e2488c72ff103861ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172050001700192049000900209099002900218100002800247245010500275264001000380300004500390336002600435337002800461338002700489500002800516502004100544500001000585504004100595500003400636520181900670650004202489650003702531650002602568650002302594655002702617700004202644700004702686700004702733700004702780710005802827856016902885856007803054856015603132994001203288999007903300in0000107680520200904152555.0920402s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm25575556  9AFQ0453AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)25575556 4aQC901.A1bL4  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaL6531 aLeung, Lai-yung,d1960-10aVariability and predictability of the surface temperature field on a zonally symmetric land planet / 1c1991.  axi, 124 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This approach uses various information measures based on entropy to define the limits of predictability and to quantify the information given by different climate components and boundary forcings about the prediction of future climate anomalies. Together with a set of basis functions defined through frequency dependent empirical orthogonal functions, this method provides a systematic way of studying the regional predictability of a complex system. The method is applied to study predictability of the atmosphere simulated by the NCAR CCM0 on a zonally symmetric land planet. By removing the ocean in the simulation, the time scale of the system has been greatly reduced. Hence, this simulation provides sufficient time samples for realistic study of the properties of the atmospheric component. Atmospheric variability as simulated under the various idealized boundary conditions is studied. This provides noise climatologies useful for climate sensitivity experiments. The space-time statistics of the simulated surface temperature field are fitted satisfactorily by a stochastic climate model with only five parameters. This suggests the usefulness of simple statistical models as guidance for climate sensitivity studies, and sampling considerations for model simulation or data collection. The limit of predictability of the first kind of the surface temperature field is found over two zonal bands: tropics (0°-20°) and mid-latitudes (40°-60°). The predictability as a function of spherical harmonic degree is also evaluated. Results are consistent with past studies of atmospheric predictability using random perturbation experiments. Extension of the above study to climate predictability of the second kind is discussed. 0aAtmospheric temperaturexForecasting. 0aClimatologyxSimulation methods. 0aTime-series analysis. 4aMajor meteorology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aNorth, Gerald R.,edegree supervisor.1 aPanetta, Lee R.,edegree committee member.1 aParzen, Emanuel,edegree committee member.1 aReid, Robert O.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913396341xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1235790zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747613511&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs83a9b808-2080-3116-827a-d5681b14c930id448fe17-78a1-3da8-8637-05a6cda249a804291ctm a2200553Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099002900201100003200230245013400262264001000396300004800406336002600454337002800480338002700508500002800535502004100563500001000604504004100614500003500655520199600690650003702686650004102723650003502764650004002799650002402839650003702863650005102900650005602951650005703007651004003064655004603104655002703150700004003177700004703217700004503264700004503309710005803354856007803412856015603490994001203646999007903658in0000111032120200904152605.0921224s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm27174590  9AFU9945AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)27174590  af-cm---  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaT1361 aTakow, Julius Agbor,d1955-10aSoil classification and phosphorus relationships as influenced by soil iron and manganese in soils of the Mbo Plain in Cameroon / 1c1991.  axviii, 305 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The objectives of this study were to classify these soils using the United States Soil Taxonomy System and to determine P, Fe, and Mn status at four sublocations (Nzock5, Mbomi4, Mbomi2 and Mbomi10) of the Mbo Plain. Two pedons were described at each sublocation. Phosphate rates (0, 25, 50, and 75 mg P kg^-1) and sources (triple superphosphate, TSP; dicalcium phosphate, DCP; and tricalcium phosphate, TCP) were evaluated in pots for rice (Oryza sativa L ) in Cameroon. Rice yields at varying rates of P using reagent grade monocalcium phosphate on soils of the Mbo Plain and two soils from the gulf coast of Texas was determined in the greenhouse at College Station. Phosphate fractionation and sorption isotherms were evaluated to determine P requirements of rice. Properties of the Mbo Plain soils were similar in all sublocations. The texture alternated between clay and clay loam. Base saturation was low and ranged from 4 to 52%. Soils are acidic with a water pH range of 3.8 to 5.0. Aluminum saturation percentage varied from 16 to 92%. Clay mineralogy was kaolinitic and ECEC ranged from 2.3 to 11.4 cmol kg^-1. Two taxonomic orders were identified. Pedons at Nzock5 were classified as inceptisols while pedons at Mbomi4, Mbomi2, and Mbomi10 were ultisols. The main P fractions were Al- and Fe-bound P. Sorption isotherms indicated 50 to 439 mg P kg^-1 were required to increase solution P to 0.1 mg L^-1. Triple superphosphate and DCP were suitable P sources for rice production in pots in the Mbo Plain at rates of 50 to 75 mg P kg^-1. Dry matter yield increased with P rate. Plant Ca and Mg were low for the Mbo Plain soils. Tissue concentrations were < 1.5 g Ca kg^-1 and < 1.0 g Mg kg^-1. Iron and Mn in plant tissue were present in apparent toxic concentrations (> 300 mg Fe kg^-1 and > 2500 mg Mn kg^-1).

Preliminary studies suggested that one agrichemical or diluent can improve, have no effect, or decrease insecticidal activity compared with another diluent or agrichemical. This study investigated the effects of selected oil diluents (mineral, cottonseed and soybean) and foliar nitrogen fertilizers (urea and triazone) on the efficacy of λ-cyhalothrin against Heliothis virescens (F.) larvae. The mortality of third instar H. virescens was higher on leaf-discs when λ-cyhalothrin was applied ultra low volume (ULV) in mineral oil than when the pyrethroid was applied in cottonseed or soybean oil with a controlled droplet applicator. Larval mortality was lowest when λ-cyhalothrin was conventionally applied in water through hydraulic, hollow cone nozzles. Behavior of third instar H. virescens was observed on plants sprayed with λ-cyhalothrin in a water or mineral oil diluent. Differences in behavioral responses to λ-cyhalothrin treated plants were quite evident between the diluents. Both λ-cyhalothrin treatments reduced larval feeding on squares compared with untreated plants. The mineral oil + λ-cyhalothrin residues caused larvae to remain stationary on the leaf surface or actually abandon the treated plant surface compared with λ-cyhalothrin in water where larvae continued to move about the leaf surface and feed on the squares. Lambda-cyhalothrin was more disruptive to normal behavior when applied in mineral compared with water. Spray residues of mineral oil alone caused very little change in larval behavior when compared with behavior on untreated plants. In a field experiment, λ-cyhalothrin was sprayed on fruiting cotton plants in mineral oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, and water diluents. There was an overall nonsignificant trend for λ-cyhalothrin applied in mineral oil to provide the highest control of H. virescens larval numbers and the lowest larval damage to the cotton compared with λ-cyhalothrin applied in cottonseed oil, soybean oil, or water. Lambda-cyhalothrin applied in water gave the lowest control. In spray chamber experiments with mixtures of foliar nitrogen fertilizers and λ-cyhalothrin, larval mortality on leaf discs was highest when λ-cyhalothrin was applied in a spray containing triazone. Larval mortality was lower in the urea + λ-cyhalothrin applications compared with the water + λ-cyhalothrin or triazone + λ-cyhalothrin spray mixtures.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747728601&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsfa06bc09-40ef-3f45-bebc-fe0b0503c5d5id49eda2c-ef4e-3ff2-afec-6316b37b956402692ctm a22003375a 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002000072035001400092037001800106040002200124049001500146099002800161100002600189245012700215264008100342300004500423336002600468337002800494338002700522504004100549500001000590502004000600500004500640530006200685520135200747650003402099856013302133999000902266999007902275in0000130212720190325093105.0960528s1995    xx a     b    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)34792761  9AHA4695AM  a95-39197bUMI  aTXAcTXAdUtOrBLW  aTXAMaTXAR  a1995aDissertationaD881 aDutta, Sandip,d1963-13aAn experimental and numerical study of turbulent heat transfer in orthogonally rotating two-pass ducts /cby Sandip Dutta. 1a[Place of publication not identified] :b[publisher not identified] ;c1995.  ax, 126 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

A rotating two-pass duct simulates the conditions in a serpentine coolant passage of a turbine blade.  This work is mostly experimental with support from numerical predictions.  The experiment is carried with two cross-sectional geometries, namely square and triangular cross-sections.  In rotation, the Coriolis and rotational buoyancy forces cause different heat transfer patterns from the leading and trailing surfaces.  Numerical computations with two equation turbulence models predict the complicated flow structure in rotation.  Results show that secondary flow develops in rotation.  This secondary flow redistributes the core flow and turbulence in an asymmetric fashion inside the coolant channel.  The heat transfer from the first pass trailing and the second pass leading surfaces are augmented by rotation.  However, the first pass leading and the second pass trailing surfaces show a decrease in heat transfer coefficient in rotation.  The model orientation of the coolant channel has significant effect on the secondary flow and heat transfer pattern.  Ribs placed oblique to the bulk flow generate secondary flows of their own.  This secondary flow from ribs interacts with the secondary flow from rotation and creates new characteristic processes in heat transfer. 4aMajor mechanical engineering.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=742534741&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aMARSffsb2cf2c24-2435-3027-b469-46757afdc964id4b9ba8c-027c-306f-a301-b4384c050cff03792ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002600197245008800223264001000311300004600321336002600367337002800393338002700421504004100448500001000489502004100499500003200540520218900572650002102761655002702782700004302809700004602852700005202898700004902950710005802999856007803057856015603135994001203291999007903303in0000129945820200904152732.0960605s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34872170  9AHA6233AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34872170  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaL6761 aLewis, Tanya Maranda.10aMass spectrometric characterization of water soluble organics in heavy oil retort / 1c1994.  axiv, 164 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Elements of the scheme include a method for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (MS-MS) with electron impact and fast atom bombardment ionization and a computerized library search. GC-MS, HRMS and MS-MS are well-established as powerful and versatile tools for identifying components of organic mixtures. Many improvements have been incorporated in order to provide the maximum amount of information that can be derived from the mass spectrometry methodologies. Each element of the analytical scheme is applied to complex samples of aqueous organic materials extracted from heavy oil retorts. The project focuses on development of methods rather than acquisition of compositional data; therefore, emphasis is placed on data which most clearly illustrate the utility and limitations of a given method. Criteria is developed to evaluate the informational content of the mass spectrometric methods. The elements of the scheme provide different perspectives on components in a highly complex sample. Each methodology supplies specific data not obtainable from other methods. GC-MS serves as an excellent survey analysis, and when combined with selective ion monitoring and the library search program, isolates specific groups of compounds without extensive sample treatment. MS-MS and the library search program are used to extract structural information. HRMS is used to determine elemental composition of mass resolved ions. PBM assists in structure elucidation by providing state-of-the-art library retrieval capabilities. PBM compensates both for the presence of mixtures in an unknown and for the wide variety of experimental conditions under which the reference library compounds were run. The inherent analytical power of the individual methodologies is extensive; however, results indicate that the mass spectrometry methods are used most effectively in concert with each other. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aRussell, David H.,edegree supervisor.1 aBrown, Kirk W.,edegree committee member.1 aSchweikert, Emile A.,edegree committee member.1 aZingaro, Ralph A.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554773zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741325101&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffse64c46c7-3258-386b-a136-969b092b6c2fid4db8a79-2d9c-36bf-9cfe-f7c96be7acc404114ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003400218245009300252264001000345300004400355336002600399337002800425338002700453504004100480500001000521502004100531500004100572520232100613650002202934650003502956650001702991650002103008650003003029655002703059700004403086700004903130700004903179700004503228710005803273856007803331856015603409994001203565999007903577in0000120284820200904152641.0941031s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31381245  9AGM7491AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31381245  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaW2351 aWalters, Peter Hudson,d1959-14aThe effect of three different goal setting methods on bench press strength performance / 1c1992.  axi, 86 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Locke, Shaw, Saari, and Latham (1981) reported, "The beneficial effect of goal setting on task performance is one of the most robust and replicated findings in the psychological literature" (p. 125). For quite some time, coaches and athletes have assumed that the beneficial effects of goal setting observed in industry can also be applied to athletic endeavors. However, recent scientific investigations examining the effects of goal setting conducted in a physical education/sport environment have yielded equivocal responses. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of three different goal setting methods on bench press strength performance in order that a more thorough understanding of the factors that contribute to the success or failure of goal setting within sports could be examined. One hundred eighty-seven beginning and intermediate collegiate males and females enrolled in six weight training classes were assigned three different goal setting treatments during a 14-week semester. The three goal setting conditions were authoritarian, collaborative, and "do your best". Subjects in the autocratic goal setting group received a specific strength objective by the instructor. Subjects in the collaborative goal setting group established a strength training objective in conjunction with the instructor. Individuals in the "do your best" goal setting condition were verbally challenged to exert maximal physical effort throughout the experiment. The dependent variable was a one repetition maximum lift in the supine bench press. Pre, mid, and post tests were administered to examine the subjects' strength performance throughout the experiment. Subjects were classified according to the method of goal setting, gender, and experience. The data were analyzed using a three-factor factorial with repeated measures on the last factor (Time). A significant main effect was observed at the.05 level for both Time and Experience. No other main effects or interactions were significant. Subjects, regardless of the goal setting treatment, did not perform significantly different from one another in the dependent variable. 0aGoal (Psychology) 0aSportsxPsychological aspects. 0aPerformance. 0aWeight training. 4aMajor physical education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aChevrette, John M.,edegree supervisor.1 aBarker, Donald G.,edegree committee member.1 aPender, Robert H.,edegree committee member.1 aTolson, Homer,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1433690zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746279561&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6c710df9-a85a-32d6-b08c-0f1f117b6708id50b48c7-e6e2-3ef0-b87b-dd1d78f3d0db02531ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002300197245016100220264001000381300004700391336002600438337002800464338002700492504004100519500001000560502004100570500004000611520085000651650002901501655002701530700004001557700004401597700004801641700004901689710005801738856015601796856007801952994001202030999007902042in0000129901920200904152729.0960603s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34844167  9AHA5759AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34844167  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaD5791 aDilly, Ronald Lee.10aApplication of pullout test fracture strength and theory toward a quality management system for controlling concrete pavement cracks /cby Ronald Lee Dilly. 1c1994.  axiii, 182 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Two instrumented pullout testing apparatuses were designed and experimentally investigated for measuring early age in-place fracture mechanics characteristics. A large apex angle pullout testing apparatus is shown to provide fracturing properties that relate to the stress intensity factor obtained using the size effect law. Experimental results are shown to closely agree with a numerical model that was aeveiopea using the finite element method.

The population was all secondary agricultural science students in Texas in the fall of 1989. A random sample of agricultural science programs was selected and surveyed using a data collection instrument. Descriptive statistics were used for reporting the personal and situational characteristics of the respondents. Relationships among these characteristics were determined using crosstabulations with chi square and Cramer's V statistics. Reasons for enrollment, for joining the FFA or not joining the FFA, and perceptions of SAEP were determined by factor analyzing items in the survey instrument. Relationships among selected personal and situational characteristics and respondents' reasons for enrolling, reasons for joining or not joining the FFA, and perceptions of SAEP were determined by analysis of variance. The major findings of this study were as follows: 1.Enrollment in agricultural science by gender and ethnicity was disproportionate to enrollment by gender and ethnicity in secondary schools statewide. 2.  A low relationship existed between year of first enrollment in agriculture and gender, place of residence, and type of SAEP conducted. 3. A negligible relationship existed between year of first enrollment in agriculture and ethnicity. 4. A negligible relationship existed between status of FFA membership and ethnicity and gender. 5. Secondary students who enrolled did so because of the characteristics of the class and because they believed that enrollment enhanced their identity. 6. Secondary students did not enroll because of the influence of significant others or because of circumstantial reasons. 7. Agricultural science students who joined the FFA did so primarily because membership enhanced their identity. To a lesser degree, they joined because of activities offered by the FFA. 8. Overall, no single factor was identified as to why some agricultural science students did not join the FFA.20aTexas Association of Future Farmers of AmericaxMembership. 0aAgricultural studentszTexasxAttitudes. 0aAgriculturexStudy and teaching (Secondary)zTexas.27aTexas Association of Future Farmers of America.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00633588 7aAgricultural studentsxAttitudes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00801295 7aAgriculturexStudy and teaching (Secondary)2fast0(OCoLC)fst00801683 7aMembership requirements.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01353685 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 4aMajor agricultural education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHerring, Don R.,edegree supervisor.1 aBriers, Gary E.,edegree committee member.1 aHoyle, John R.,edegree committee member.1 aTownsend, Joe D.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:910696441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1163134zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745099461&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs4a0d96a5-2c7c-3748-8a8c-167626f6668bid72d7936-95d4-30de-bbbd-c76024fe9e8003485ctm a2200565Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160043001200180049000900192099003000201100002400231245018800255264001000443300004700453336002600500337002800526338002700554504004100581500001000622502004100632500004000673520083000713650007801543650006901621650006301690650006401753650004401817650004001861650002901901650005101930650007501981650008902056650005502145650007402200651004502274655002702319700004102346700005302387700005102440700004502491710005802536856007802594856015602672994001202828999007902840in0000119853220200904152640.0940928s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31191643  9AGJ0449AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31191643  an-us---  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaT99821 aTzoumis, Kelly Ann.14aThe role of public involvement in managing political conflict :ba comparative case study of public involvement activities in siting low- level radioactive waste disposal facilities / 1c1992.  aviii, 292 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Data were gathered from sixty-five telephone interviews and comparisons made with ten national experts. Public involvement and compensation packages (reviewed in Chapter IV) to be potential conflict management tools for practitioners. The role of the governor and the complexity of the siting process are two additional factors that are important in escalating a conflict. Technical factors of complexity and source of the waste along with the past performance of the company handling the facility have no link to conflict. Conflict escalation is proposed as a means towards understanding the agenda-building process. 0aLow level radioactive waste disposal facilitiesxLocationzUnited States. 0aLow level radioactive waste disposal facilitiesxPublic opinion. 0aRadioactive waste sitesxPolitical aspectszUnited States. 0aEnvironmental policyzUnited StatesxCitizen participation. 0aPolitical participationzUnited States. 0aConflict managementzUnited States. 4aMajor political science. 7aConflict management.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00874778 7aEnvironmental policyxCitizen participation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00913256 7aLow level radioactive waste disposal facilitiesxLocation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01003142 7aPolitical participation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01069386 7aRadioactive waste sitesxPolitical aspects.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01087956 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aJones, Bryan D.,edegree supervisor.1 aBaumgartner, Frank R.,edegree committee member.1 aHurley, Patricia A.,edegree committee member.1 aRuch, Carl E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1397375zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746282751&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsead95261-8346-373e-9925-46880cab89bdid76d41fe-c963-318b-8dfe-1637f3afe77902862cam a2200361K  4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035002000095035001400115040003500129035001900164049000900183099002900192100002200221245007100243264003500314300003000349336002600379337002800405338002700433502006100460520144800521650003401969655002702003700004102030700004702071710005802118856007702176856015602253994001202409999007902421in0000018357720190325091325.0791215s1973    txua     m    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm05798036  a(OCoLC)05798036  9AAU4923AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)5798036  aTXAM  a1973aDissertationaB5751 aBhar, Tarak Nath.10aElectrical and optical properties of ion-activated CdS thin films. 1a[College Station, Tex.]c1973.  a113 leavesbillustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  bPh.

An optimum doping density, anneal temperature and time for maximum sensitization has been determined. With an implantation dose of 10(exponent_15) ions cm(exponent_-2) the light-to-dark current ratio is 50 times that of an unimplanted sample for an illumination level of 75 foot-candles. Damage which resulted due to implantation is studied with Scanning Electron Microscopy. The observed dark spots are interpreted as small interstitial clusters or unresolvable interstitial dislocation loops produced by displacement cascades from the bombarding ions. Observed superlinearity of photo current with light intensity is supported with a theoretical calculation based on a two-state model. Theoretical calculations are made from both closed form and numerical analytical approaches. Spectral response curves are interpreted in terms of volume and surface excitation of photo-carriers. In addition it is noted that the threshold for the absorption edge can be varied and the longer wavelength spectral response can be broadened with implantation dose. Variation of time constants with doping densities and light intensity is experimentally determined and theoretically analyzed. Moreover, their wavelength dependence is noted. A linear trap distribution profile affecting the response time characteristics is observed. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLinder, John S.,edegree supervisor.1 aMcCulley, W.

Some problems have been created by the shift in preferred treatment locations from institutions to community-based residences. Individuals served in the institutions must acquire the interpersonal skills necessary to succeed in community-based service settings. One of the prevailing mental illnesses of clients in institutions is autism (autistic disorder or pervasive developmental disorder). Due to the presenting problems of autism (language deficiencies, withdrawal from others, and obsessive desires for sameness) coupled with extremely low intelligence because of mental retardation, specific training strategies must be identified and implemented for deinstitutionalization to continue. The purpose of this study was to develop a training sequence which would assist the direct care workers at state institutions to provide more effective direct training to the clients. The training sequence was designed to instruct the direct care staff to: (1) Identify the severe deficiencies related to autism. (2) Identity instructional strategies which will compensate for the deficiencies of autism. (3) Model effective teaching strategies. The training sequence was field tested at Brenham State School, Fannin Unit, Brenham, Texas. The subjects in the field test were direct care workers on Fannin Unit. The record of study includes a review of the current literature, a description of the procedures utilized in developing the training sequence, a report of the results of the field test, and the recommendations of the researcher. The training package used in the field test is also included in the report. 0aAutistic childrenxEducation. 0aChildren with mental disabilitiesxEducation. 0aSpecial education teachersxTraining of. 4aMajor industrial education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHouseholder, Daniel L.,edegree supervisor.1 aBurger, Michael,edegree committee member.1 aSchoenfeldt, Lyle F.,edegree committee member.1 aYoung, LaVerne H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913389941xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1229762zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747387401&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs74d1e00b-f627-3408-9850-1096d61a90c9id7d7f27f-ab7b-3502-8e4b-856c57c9df0103781ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002600209245015600235264001000391300004500401336002600446337002800472338002700500504004100527500001000568502004100578500003500619520194100654650002402595655002702619700005102646700005002697700004802747700004802795710005802843856015602901856007803057856013303135994001203268999007903280in0000129833620200904152729.0960513s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34713842  9AHA1601AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34713842  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaE2941 aEgilla, Jonathan Nda.10aInfluence of potassium on drought resistance, root physiology, and root longevity of Hibiscus rosa sinensis L. cv.

Leprecaun were studied in a series of greenhouse experiments. Plants were fertilized with fullstrength Hoagland's nutrient solution containing 0,2.5, and 10 mM K (K1? K2 , and K3 , respectively). Root longevity was determined by the percentage of post-drought stress live-roots (PLR), using 8 6 Rb+ labeling. Total, shoot, root and leaf dry weight increased; while root:shoot ratio, and leaf area ratio of both drought-stressed and non-drought stressed plants decreased from Kj to K2 , respectively. Regardless of drought treatment, leaf area was always greatest in K3 plants, and drought stress reduced SLA of K2 and K3 plants. Thus at higher K, the transpiring surface area of the leaves was reduced relative to the photosynthetic mesophyll volume. High K (2.5 to 3.0% leaf K) increased the PLR under drought conditions (-1.5 MPa VPL). At K2 and K3, plants had higher relative water content (RWC), compared to Kj plants. Leaf Ca and Mg concentration decreased at K levels above 2.5 to 3.0%. At peak drought, photosynthesis (A) was highest in K2 plants, whereas transpiration (E) was lowest in K3 plants. WUE,- decreased as 'P l was reduced by drought stress from -0.5 MPa to -1.5 Mpa. Leaf osmotic potential ('FJC) was highest (less negative) and turgor potential ('Pp) was lowest in Kj plants. Drought-stressed plants had lower A compared to non-drought stressed plants at all K levels except for K2 in experiment 2. At peak drought, A was lower at K3, despite higher A in K2 plants. This indicates increased drought tolerance in H. rosa sinensis, at leaf K concentration in the range 2.5 to 3.0%. 4aMajor horticulture. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDavies, Jr., Frederick T.,edegree supervisor.1 aBoutton, Thomas W.,edegree committee member.1 aDrew, Malcolm C.,edegree committee member.1 aCobb, Gregory B.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740895971&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1550398zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740895971&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffs2fcd73b9-575f-37c5-af9a-4f9bbdffe543id841b8fe-e414-3c6f-b356-dd242b8d7e7204103ctm a2200409Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099003000168100003100198245014700229264001000376300004700386336002600433337002800459338002700487504004100514500001000555502004100565500004900606520240400655650003803059655002703097700004303124700004603167700004803213700004903261710005803310856007803368856015603446994001203602999007903614in0000129182820200904152732.0960501s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34659168  9AGZ9058AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34659168  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaL72831 aLiles, Edwin Dwain,d1940-12aA comparison of administrator and research expectations for the twenty-first century middle school science and mathematics programs in Texas / 1c1993.  axvii, 312 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The responses of the two groups of professionals were obtained with the Delphi method and analyzed based on central tendency and variance to determine what level of correlation existed. Major research findings for the study indicated: (1) Administrators and researchers are expecting the middle school science and mathematics classes in Texas in the next century to be based on promoting interdisciplinary and thematic hands-on problem solving activities involving process skills in a real world context and application for all students. (2) The participants in the study expect the focus to be on topics that offer positive, exciting, and realistic science/mathematics experiences with the use of state of the art calculators, computers, and other technology in all aspects of the curriculum. (3) Analysis of central tendency, variance, and correlation indicate a close correlation of agreement between the responses of both groups of professionals. The research supports the premise that administrators appear to be prepared to implement reforms in science and mathematics education which will help Texas school children. Based on the findings of the study, recommendations include: (1) The results of this study should be made available to science and mathematics coordinators and directors of research projects so as to assist planning officers in systematically coordinating efforts to implement curriculum reform. (2) Texas school districts should provide meaningful inservice aimed at providing knowledge and skills needed by school administrators for the role of educational leader. (3) The Texas Education Agency should make every effort to provide necessary resources needed for science and mathematics education reform, including up to date technology. (4) Future-oriented administrators should become involved in collaboratives with innovative university professors in developing educational strategies for science and mathematics instruction. (5) A similar Delphi study should be conducted comparing the results of this study with the expectations of business and industry with the objective of determining a level of correlation and to obtain support from business and industry. 4aMajor educational administration. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStark, Stephen L.,edegree supervisor.1 aHoyle, John R.,edegree committee member.1 aOates, Arnold D.,edegree committee member.1 aStuessy, Carol L.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1547992zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740810791&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs4555793b-ff03-347a-942b-064a56f1768bid8b3ecca-4a4c-393e-8008-841b3c2e210902835ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002800194100001600222245007500238264001000313300004400323336002600367337002800393338002700421504004100448500001000489502004100499500004500540520089500585650002801480650004301508650002101551650003401572655002701606700004801633700005101681700004501732700004801777710005801825856016901883856007802052856015602130994001202286999007902298in0000123785320200904152713.0950510s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32449702  9AGS3651AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32449702  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaK821 aKong, Ning.10aSequence estimation and synchronization from nonsynchronized samples / 1c1993.  aix, 84 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

For the Poisson channel, a receiver that performs jointly sequence estimation and synchronization for arbitrary sampling rates and arbitrary pulse shapes is developed and its error probability studied. For the Gaussian channel, three different aspects of the receiver are studied: 1) using an integrate-and-dump filter instead of a matched-filter. 2) using rational sampling rates instead of integer sampling rates; and, 3) using a low-pass filter after the matched-filter instead of sampling the output of the matched-filter directly. The performances in terms of the error probability and the Cramer-Rao lower-bound on the mean square timing error are studied for the above methods. It is found that each method has its advantages and disadvantages. 0aDigital communications. 0aSynchronous data transmission systems. 0aSynchronization. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aGeorghiades, Costas N.,edegree supervisor.1 aGriswold, Norman C.,edegree committee member.1 aHsing, Tailen,edegree committee member.1 aPainter, John H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932875741xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1477221zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747687841&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6d03c86a-7452-3e0b-a645-1935119753a9id9f03623-a29d-3ed5-a252-352ff92f83a304215ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040007000109035002000179050002300199049000900222099002900231100002500260245013300285264001000418300004600428336002600474337002800500338002700528500002800555502004100583500001000624504004100634500004400675520228100719650004303000650005003043650002603093650003303119655002703152700003803179700004903217700004603266700005003312710005803362856007803420856015603498994001203654999007903666in0000111233320200904152609.0921015s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm26788693  9AFU7020AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLdOCLCQdFCMBLdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)2678869314aE185.86b.W87 1991  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaW9511 aWright, Lynda Brown.13aAn investigation of psychosocial variables related to academic achievement among fourth and fifth grade African American males / 1c1991.  axvi, 162 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The child development literature suggests a differential educational experience among young African males when compared to their peers. The researcher's intent was to examine selected psychosocial variables to determine any relationship which might exist between the variables and academic achievement. Major questions were 1) whether there exists a relationship between academic achievement and the way the young African American males feel about and perceive themselves, their attitude toward school, and their family environment, 2) which of the self-esteem, self-perception and attitude toward school variables and which of the family environment variables are the best predictors of academic achievement, and 3) whether there exists differences in achievement based on selected demographic characteristics. Subjects for the study were 61 African American males enrolled in the fourth and fifth grades from four elementary schools in the southeast. The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills mean scores and summed grade point averages in reading, mathematics, and science were used as measures of achievement. The Hare Self-Esteem Scale and the Self-Perception Profile for Children served as measures of the way the young males felt about and perceived themselves. The Quality of School Life Scale was used to assess attitude toward school. The Family Environment Scale served as a measure of the "family climate" and a researcher questionnaire was used to obtain selected demographic information. Results of the study indicated that the following variables were significantly related to academic achievement: peer, home, school, and general self-esteem, scholastic competence, global self-worth, commitment to classwork, intellectual-cultural orientation and achievement orientation. The most salient psychosocial variables for predicting academic achievement included the total Hare, achievement orientation, control and physical appearance. The young males achieved significant differences in achievement based on the level of formal education completed by the mother/female guardian and by the father/male guardian... 0aAfrican American studentsxPsychology. 0aAfrican American studentsxSocial conditions. 0aAcademic achievement. 4aMajor counseling psychology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAsh, Michael,edegree supervisor.1 aBarker, Donald G.,edegree committee member.1 aDuffy, michael,edegree committee member.1 aLarke, Patricia J.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1274321zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744858411&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsf4136a55-b48f-36bb-aaf3-c448e5547abcidaa1c682-2c9f-3875-b045-40137c8f1d3804645cam a22004938a 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031010001700072020001500089035002000104035001400124035001900138035001000157040002700167049001200194050002500206096002100231100003100252245008900283264010000372300004500472336002600517337002500543338002700568490003800595504005100633505056300684505055401247505059201801505050302393505057602896505035703472650001403829650001603843650002503859650002003884650002403904700002503928700001903953830003903972948005204011999000904063999007904072in0000448666920191202143835.0940413s1994    nyua     b    001 0 eng    a   94013939   a0195080130  a(OCoLC)30356456  9AAG1630MS  z(UtOrBLW)19405  a31773  aDLCcDLCdTMVdUtOrBLW  aTMVMc100aQP33.6.C48bB37 1994  aQT 4bB321f 19941 aBassingthwaighte, James B.10aFractal physiology /cJames B.

In the two sample problem, it is desired to test the null hypothesis that two independent random samples have a common distribution function. Assuming certain conditions on the distribution functions, a procedure is proposed which has strong graphical elements, a sound theoretical foundation, and estimates the relation of the two distributions if the null hypothesis is rejected. The proposed procedure has as its motivation the estimation of the comparison density and inference concerning its uniformity. The proposed procedure is both a statistical test of the null hypothesis and a model selection criterion. The test is based on components of a new stochastic process which is termed the kernel density process. This process is based on a boundary kernel estimate of the comparison density. It is proposed to apply a new test, the subset chi-square test, to these components. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the components found to be significant are used to construct a damped orthogonal series estimate of the comparison density. The power of the proposed test under local alternatives is compared to two commonly used portmanteau statistics, the Cramer-von Mises and the Anderson-Darling, and to a third statistic suggested by this work. A new method for finding the power of these statistics under local alternatives is given. This method uses the fast Fourier transform to invert an approximation to the characteristic function of the statistic. The proposed test is seen to have good power properties. A simulation study is conducted to examine its small sample size.

This study was conducted during a ten-week intensive English language summer program.  The data was collected with foreign students and ESL teachers teaching an intermediate composition class (200 level), an intermediate grammar class (200 level) and an advanced listening class (300 level) in an English Language Institute in the United States.  Initial and final interviews with new and returning foreign students were conducted.  The data also included interviews with key personnel, and classroom observations (included videotaping). Additional data regarding assessment was provided by both the new and returning students and the key personnel.  The data was sorted, resorted, categorized and analyzed to determine the factors that affected English as a second language learning for the particular group of participants involved in the study. The findings of this study suggest that second language (English) learners believe that there are a number of factors and difficulties that have a negative or positive effect as to how and why people learn a second language: age; attitude/behavior; aptitude; exposure to formal and informal instruction; immersion into the target language, culture, and environment; background experiences; personality and willingness to take risks; travelling experiences; comparability between the native/first or second language and the target language; feelings and expectations; external helpers; strategies to deal with target language speakers in real life situations; interactions with target language speakers; degree of oral language proficiency; target language speakers' attitudes toward second language learners; long term goals and learners' motivation for learning the target language; cognitive strategies to improve target language skills; and socio-cultural issues. Classroom environment issues were found to be associated with: student to student interaction (including motivation to work with classmates, perceptions of other classmates, and acceptance of classmates' personalities); teacher and student interaction; and physical layout of the classrooms. 4aMajor curriculum and instruction.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=742117091&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aMARSffsf25e4718-6b28-36b0-8017-51ef6569efaeide4e901c-ed48-3d93-adab-cdeee640162503775ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003700109035002000146049000900166099002900175100002600204245013200230264001000362300004700372336002600419337002800445338002700473500002800500502004100528500001000569504004100579500003200620520192300652650003502575650003702610650003202647650001302679650002102692655002702713700004302740700004602783700004702829700004602876710005802922856007802980856015603058994001203214999007903226in0000104302120200904152534.0910905s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24335426  9AFG7529AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdTXA  a(OCoLC)24335426  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS6961 aSon, Kyung-Ae,d1959-10aDichromium and dimolybdenum complexes with tertiary phosphines, and new iron(II) chloride complexes with oxygen donor ligands / 1c1990.  axiii, 145 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The reaction of two equivalents of Na(Hg) with Cr2Cl6(dmpm)2 yields Cr2Cl4(dmpm)2 in which we expected to find multiple Cr-Cr bonds. However, the dichromium(II) compound, Cr2Cl4 (dmpm)2, avoids any Cr-Cr bond formation by adopting a bizarre structure. Cr2Cl4(dmpm)2 reacts with methanol to yield Cr2Cl4(/Li-OMe)2(dmpm)2. All of the dinuclear chromium species have an edge-sharing bioctahedral structure except for Cr2Cl4(dmpm)2, where each Cr atom is in a trigonal bipyramidal coordination sphere, with a common Cl...Cl edge. The reaction of MoC13(THF)3 with two equivalents of the phosphine in THF yields two sorts of compound, Mo2Cl6(PEt3)4 and Mo2Cl6(PEt3)3, and at room temperature, Mo2Cl6(PEt3)3 becomes the principal product. Mo2Cl6(PEt3)3 exhibits a significant metal-metal interaction, whereas Mo2Cl6(Pet3)4 does not. Several new iron(II) chloride complexes with oxygen donor ligands have been prepared and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography, namely, Fe4Cl8(THF)6, [FeCl2(OPMe3)]n, and FeCl2(OPMe3)2. Fe4Cl8(THF)6 has been isolated from a solution of iron(II) chloride in THF which was obtained by reacting FeCl3 in THF with metallic iron. Either polymeric compound [FeCl2(OPMe3)]n or monomeric compound FeCl2(OPMe3)2 can be obtained from the reaction of a usefully reactive solution of iron(II) chloride in THF with OPMe3 by adjustment of the OPMe3 concentration. Full details about the syntheses, structure, characterization and magnetic properties of these tertiary phosphine complexes of dichromium and dimolybdenum, and of the iron(II) chloride compounds with oxygen donor ligands are given. 0aChromium compoundsxStructure. 0aMolybdenum compoundsxStructure. 0aFerric chloridexStructure. 0aLigands. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aCotton, F.

A semi-classical approximation to the relative motion of the two incident particles is made and the resulting second-order diagram is calculated. This is done by using a Monte Carlo computer program which evaluates the neccessary seven-dimensional integration. The current matrix elements which occur in the the calculation are generated directly in the frame where they are needed, rather than using a previous approach of generating them in the Breit frame and boosting them. We find the approximations made in this earlier approach are not adequate. We apply our calculations to a variety of systems. Electron-positron production in π[^-] - p collisions at p[π] = 17 GeV is studied. A majority of the predicted pairs are found to arise from this two-photon mechanism if the spin-flip part of the proton current is included. This mechanism has previously been overlooked. The current matrix element to this proton to delta transition contibution is explicitly given. The method is used to predict proton-proton pair production for scattering, which is of fundamental interest as a basic mechanism for any nucleus-nucleus collision. The systems 3He-3He, 3He-4He, and 4He-4He are proposed as a clean way of experimentally separating the spin flip from the non-flip processes, and predictions are made for these systems.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744866791&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsbe12893d-77db-31b9-bbb3-e04fa2ef65cdie25c3c18-6ae6-3474-b84f-78ecdd206fe904284ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035002300095035002000118040005400138019001300192035003700205043001200242050001900254049000900273099002800282100003200310245007000342264001000412300004500422336002600467337002800493338002700521502007900548500003700627504004100664500001000705520243800715650004203153650002803195655002703223700004203250700004603292700005303338700004103391710005803432856007703490856015603567994001203723999007903735in0000170265620200904152734.0021021s2002    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm50766142  a(OCoLC)ocm50813267  a(OCoLC)50813267  aTAIbengcTAIdOCLCQdTXAdUMIdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a50813267  a(OCoLC)50766142z(OCoLC)50813267  an-us-tx 4aAS36.T3bAppel  aTXAM  a2002aDissertationaA621 aAppelt, Christopher Warren.10aEcological correlates of Harris' hawk grouping in southern Texas. 1c2002.  axi, 121 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  bPh.

Objectives were to: I) determine relationships among landscape use, grouping and abundance across sites, 2) characterize variation in grouping associated with rainfall patterns in the brushland and grassland ecoregions of the study area, and 3) explore which landscape measures best explained within site variation in grouping, considering 3 spatial scales (mesohabitat, territory, home range). Although abundance was higher (17.1 ± 4.1 hawks/100km) than reported for more arid regions, observations of groups (>2 hawks) varied across sites (0.113 ± 0.037 groups/observation). Groups were not observed at 3 of 4 sites in the wetter, eastern grassland, where abundance was slightly lower than brushland. One grassland site with abundant hawks and groups was a drier, habitat fragment in a landscape devoid o f woody vegetation. Abundance correlated with grouping but not with the landscape variables measured. However, hawks were typically found in areas with less fragmented woody vegetation. Vegetation strata differed between random points and hawk locations at 5 sites, four of which had groups, but differences could not be generalized across sites. Sightings of 3 hawks were more likely to be at brushland than grassland locations (z = 2.34, p < 0.05). Larger groups (4-5 hawks) and groups with young-of-the-year were sighted infrequently with no differences between ecoregions. Two indices of grouping were significantly negatively correlated with rainfall recorded near each site in the same year, but not with indices o f rainfall during the previous year. Only subtle differences in landscape vegetation were found between areas around grouped and non-grouped Harris' hawk locations. I compared vegetation patterns at three ecologically appropriate scales. The greatest differences were observed at the finest scale (simulating mesohabitat), leading to hypotheses related to prey availability for this group-hunting predator and distribution of scarce resources (e.g., water). Results were interpreted relative to the Ecological Constraints Model predicting groups in harsh environments. To refine testable predictions from this model, I recommend using spatially explicit landscape measures to document distribution of resources relative to groups. 0aHarris's hawkxEcologyzTexas, South. 4aMajor wildlife science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPackard, Jane M.,edegree supervisor.1 aDe Young, Charles A.,edegree supervisor.1 aChavez-Ramirez, Felipe,edegree comittee member.1 aWu, X.

Bisphenol-A Polycarbonate (BPAPC) is known for its superior mechanical properties which makes this material an attractive alternative for many applications.  Over time however, the mechanical integrity of this polycarbonate deteriorates, leaving a brittle, low strength material, though no observable chemical change has taken place.  This phenomena is observed in most glassy polymers and is termed physical aging.  The physical aging mechanism is examined by two phases of work in this study.  The first phase entails analysis of physically aged, high molecular weight BPAPC plaques using Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS).  Using a high temperature stage on the WAXS Diffractometer, it is possible to anneal, or physically age BPAPC samples while in the x-ray beam, following the aging mechanism first hand. Through this technique the morphological changes of the polymer are followed as a sample is aged for 100 hrs.  The second phase entails examination of conformational changes on a more segmental level.  Applying Raman Spectroscopic techniques developed in the Laane and Letton laboratories, it is possible to directly monitor conformational changes of aged samples by observing vibrational frequency shifts as small as 0.2 cm-1. Through the above research, it was confirmed that physical aging enhances the over all order of the BPAPC polymer chains through a decrease in the amorphous nature of the sample.  Moreover, mechanisms which impose orientation in the sample effect the inter-molecular vibrations more significantly than the intra- or lateral vibrational modes.  Ultimately, the information derived from above will be used to enhance the current understanding of the structure/property relationships of materials. 4aMajor chemistry.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=742145611&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aMARSffse5f911b3-f3e2-3153-9008-8aaa89539df1ie36687ee-fa8f-3aac-9168-75b1e0b3c55d03660ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002500209245009400234264001000328300004700338336002600385337002800411338002700439504004100466500001000507502004100517500004300558520182800601650003202429655002702461700004802488700004802536700005402584700004802638710005802686856016902744856007802913856015602991994001203147999007903159in0000128404620200904152705.0960328s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34483692  9AGX6132AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34483692  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG2151 aGarcia, Blanca Rosa.10aEffect of group size on learning via interactive video instruction in nursing education / 1c1993.  axiii, 169 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Different group sizes were used with interactive video instruction (IVI) in a curriculum unit on nursing care of the cardiac patient. The groups used cooperative learning principles in a context-based application of the concepts learned in the classroom. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine data. In the ANCOVAs the pre-test was the covariate. Cell means on pre-tests, post-tests, gains, percent gains, time to complete the program, student preference of computers, group functioning, and student perceptions of group functioning were studied. The students in two day-sections were randomly assigned to three treatment groups since the random selection of students was not possible. Analyses of ethnicity, gender, and age were included. A significant interaction between age and treatment was identified at the.035 significance level. Results indicated when the pre-test was used as the covariate, group size did not affect the post-test. The effects of ethnicity, gender, and age did not produce significant differences with group size. Since no significant differences were found, the large group treatment is warranted in terms of achievement. In terms of satisfaction, however, students stated a preference for small groups. Group functioning when combined with cooperative learning principles for IVI provided more interactions in small groups and promoted positive student interactions in small and large groups. Students verbalized positive responses to flexible lab scheduling, presence and clarity of objectives, and knowledge concerning the amount of time it would take to complete the IVI. Recommendations for the institution, designers, and further research are provided. 4aMajor industrial education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aYoung-Hawkins, LaVerne,edegree supervisor.1 aBonham, Adrianne,edegree committee member.1 aHouseholder, Daniel L.,edegree committee member.1 aRieber, Lloyd P.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941077441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1526014zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745768611&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsed34acb0-dd10-3334-bf72-a4223a3a66f6ie4419d9c-1530-34c5-94f0-8e3bf4bf769103224ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100002300217245009700240264001000337300004500347336002600392337002800418338002700446504004100473500001000514502004100524500004500565520141600610650003502026650004502061650001602106650003202122650003402154655002702188700004202215700003902257700004402296700004302340710005802383856007802441856015602519994001202675999007902687in0000120285820200904152644.0941031s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31381272  9AGM7501AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31381272  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaY221 aYang, Zhou,d1957-10aThermohydrodynamic analysis of product-lubricated hydrostatic bearings in turbulent regime / 1c1992.  axv, 142 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Pointwise evaluation of temperature and hence liquid properties is achieved through the solution of the energy equation in the fluid film with an adiabatic boundary assumption justified for HJBs with large mass flow rates. Fluid inertia on film lands and at recess edges are preserved in the analysis. Flow turbulence is accounted through turbulence shear parameters based on friction factors derived from Moody's formulae. The effects of fluid compressibility and temperature variation in the recess are included. A finite difference scheme is implemented to solve the governing equations on the film lands, while the Newton-Raphson scheme is used to update the recess pressures and to satisfy the mass continuity requirement at each recess. Comparisons between numerical results and experimental data of turbulent flow water HJBs and liquid hydrogen (LH2) HJBs show very good correlation and demonstrate the correctness and accuracy of the analysis and the numerical scheme. Large temperature-rises are determined in a roughened stator liquid oxygen (LO2) HJB, which affect strongly the operating clearance and hence the bearing performance. Thermal effects are important in cryogenic liquid HJBs. 0aBearings (Machinery)xTesting. 0aFluid-film bearingsxThermal properties. 0aTurbulence. 0aLubrication and lubricants. 4aMajor mechanical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAndres, Luis San,edegree supervisor.1 aChilds, D.

Nevertheless, Ingersoll (1977b) and Mikkelson (1985) report that managers tend to delay calling their firm's convertible securities until conversion value is well in excess of call price. I investigate two explanations of delayed calls of convertible preferred stock. First, Jaffee and Shleifer's (1990) call failure hypothesis states that managers delay calls to assure forced conversion. When a firm must give advance notice of a call, conversion value can fall below call price during the notice period. In this case, the call fails and the firm must quickly raise cash to pay the call price. Delaying calls "guarantees" forced conversion and avoids the costs of call failure. I test whether factors that increase the probability of call failure can explain excess conversion values on call announcement dates. I find very little support for the call failure hypothesis. Next, I test the Dunn and Eades' (1989) passive investor hypothesis. According to the passive investor model, firms do not follow the perfect market call policy because some investors rationally deviate from the perfect market voluntary conversion strategy. Investors who do not convert to receive large common dividends create cash flow savings for the firm. These savings can be had only if the firm delays calling. Tests offer weak support for the passive investor model. I show that convertible preferred stock often is priced less than conversion value, but not when the passive investor model predicts. I also find positive, but insignificant, cash flow benefits for firms that delay calls. Finally, I find that preferred stock that should be converted has less systematic risk than common stock. 4aMajor finance. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aDubofsky, David,edegree supervisor.1 aLee, D.

Experiments were done to examine the physiological effects of NaCl on the growth and development of cucumber leaves and roots. Sodium chloride shock caused an inhibition of growth for the first 24 to 48 hours after initial treatment The response to stress varied with the salt concentration and the age of the leaf at the time of treatment. Leaf expansion and leaf emergence decreased with increasing NaCl in the solution media. The plastochron index was delayed at 80 mM salt, but was relatively unchanged in the 40 mM salt treatment This may indicate a change in the developmental physiology of the plant at higher salt levels. Root osmotic potential decreased within thirty minutes after salt shock and remained lower than the control for at least 24 hours. The plants wilted and regained turgor within the first six hours. Root invertase activity increased after six hours in 80 mM NaCl and remained higher than the control for at least seven days. Because the invertase did not increase until six hours after salt shock, it may not be involved in the initial recovery of turgor. However, it may play a role in long term osmotic adjustment. The transport sugars sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose decreased on days 1, 3, and 5 after NaCl shock. Myo-inositol, galactose, glucose, and fructose increased on day 3 then dropped to levels similar to the controls. Melibiose increased over time, perhaps as an indication of root injury or senescence. Reducing sugars may play a role in osmotic adjustment at salt levels less than those used in this study. Elemental analysis showed that Na+ concentrations increased dramatically in the roots within 24 hours while the Ca[^2+], Mg[^2+], and K+ concentrations decreased... 0aCucumbersxEffect of salinity on. 0aCucumbersxGrowth. 0aInvertase. 4aMajor horticulture. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aCobb, B.

To understand the biological significance of the maintenance of specific base differences in the 3' 200 nucleotides of the three genomic RNAs, all possible permutations were used to exchange these regions among the genomic RNAs. When all RNAs bore the 3' end of RNA-1, the total RNA accumulation was only 15% of wild-type; when the 3' end of RNAs -2 or -3 was present on all three RNAs, the total RNA accumulation was reduced to 30 or 35% of wild-type. Two major processes were found to be involved in these dramatic differences. The first reflects the distinct and competitive strengths of the (-)-strand promoters in these sequences. The second is the importance of the context of upstream sequences in which the 3' promoter is placed. The transfer of previously constructed mutations to the 3' end of RNA-1 helped in understanding the role in BMV RNA replication of RNA-1 and the la protein encoded by it. The debilitating effect on replication of aminoacylation defective mutations when present on RNAs -1 and -2 suggests a role for aminoacylation in the replication of RNAs encoding replication-essential proteins. To understand the reason(s) behind the persistence of base differences among the three genomic RNAs and the impairing effect on replication of mutations in the 3' end, RNA-protein binding techniques were developed. Contaminating coat protein in the BMV replicase extract was found to interact specifically with two domains of RNA-1. A mutant of coat protein (lacking the first 25 amino acids) that was previously found to be defective in encapsidation was found to be incapable of binding RNAs in vitro. On the other hand, the wild-type coat protein was found to bind RNAs in a cooperative manner, which is believed to be the mechanism responsible for rapid encapsidation in vivo. 4aMajor microbiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHall, Timothy C.,edegree supervisor.1 aCarrington, J.

High frequency of hepatocellular neoplasm in fish has been found. This study was undertaken to assess the environmental contamination by analyzing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites in fish collected from Presque Isle Bay, Lake Erie, Niagara River, New York, and Galveston Bay. Method development. A method to determine PAH metabolites in fish by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was developed. Biliary metabolites were recovered by enzymatic and acidic hydrolysis. TMS-ethers of PAH metabolites were analyzed by GC/MS, the derivatization of metabolites with bis (trimethylsilylfluoro) acetamide enhanced GC/MS. Time-course response of PAH metabolites in fish. Antarctic fish (Notothenial gibberifrons) adminstered 100 $\mu$l Diesel Fuel Arctic by intramuscular injection responded rapidly with elevated PAH metabolites within 24 hours of exposure. Production of PAH metabolites was generally proportional to exposure time. The findings suggest the presence of a positive metabolite response mechanism in fish capable of rapid response to PAH exposure. Field study. Elevated concentrations of PAH metabolites correlated positively with fish neoplasm. No correlation was found between PAH concentrations in local sediments and fish neoplasms. PAH metabolites have been indentified in all three species of fish collected near the Apex barge oil spill in Galveston Bay. The total PAH metabolite concentrations were high in fish collected one week after the spill and decreased significantly four and sixteen weeks after the spill. This finding, and similar TIC patterns of PAH metabolites and PAH in Apex oil, suggests that the fish were exposed to the Apex oil. 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsxMetabolismvCase studies. 0aFishesxEffect of chemicals onvCase studies. 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydorcarbonsxEnvironmental aspectsvCase studies. 4aMajor oceanography. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBrooks, James M.,edegree supervisor.1 aWade, Terry L.,edegree supervisor1 aPresley, Bobby J.,edegree comittee member.1 aPowell, Eric N.,edegree comittee member.1 aSafe, Stephen H.,edegree comittee member.1 aRamos, Kenneth,edegree comittee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900511&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1496773zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900511&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffsb39d868c-9b99-39c7-9005-2dc9f78d2ed3ie7fedb4d-374b-33b6-8cb7-96d852e32d1002575ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100002000217245004800237264001000285300004300295336002600338337002800364338002700392500002800419502004100447500001000488504004100498500004500539520079200584650002201376650001301398650002001411650003401431655002701465700004301492700005201535700003801587700004801625700004901673710005801722856007801780856015601858994001202014999007902026in0000111233020200904152610.0921015s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm26788619  9AFU7017AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)26788619  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaY941 aYue, Wing Kong.10aElectron field emission in porous silicon / 1c1991.  ax, 83 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

When a positive potential is applied on the top of the insulating layer, electron field emission occurs in the voids. This field emission current is neither constrained by the external energy supply as in thermionic electron tube, nor is it constrained by the low carrier supply as in semiconductor devices. The study has led to the development of the oxidized porous silicon field emission devices. These devices are temperature independent. They operate at a voltage below 10 volts with high current density. The application of the devices are anticipated in vacuum integrated circuits, flat panel displays, and high frequency circuits. 0aMicroelectronics. 0aSilicon. 0aField emission. 4aMajor electrical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aParker, Donald L.,edegree supervisor.1 aCongleton, Jerome J.,edegree committee member.1 aLu, Mi,edegree committee member.1 aTaylor, Henry F.,edegree committee member.1 aWeichold, Mark H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1274318zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744867461&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs9e361f7b-3ab4-36d8-b131-ddfd45419425ie8093620-7e83-316c-8b60-c34fa1bfc09701541cam a2200385 a 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002000072035001400092037001800106040002200124043001200146049001500158099002800173100002800201245013100229264008100360300005100441336002600492337002800518338002700546504004100573500001000614502004000624500003500664530006300699650002700762650003100789650006000820650003000880650002400910856013300934999000901067999007901076in0000124503520190325092943.0951108s1995    xx ab    b    000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)33437489  9AGV5618AM  a95-34402bUMI  aTXAcTXAdUtOrBLW  an-us-tx  aTXAMaTXAR  a1995aDissertationaN631 aNoborio, Kosuke,d1955-12aA two-dimensional finite element model for solution, heat, and solute transport in furrow-irrigated soil /cby Kosuke Noborio. 1a[Place of publication not identified] :b[publisher not identified] ;c1995.  ax. 178 leaves :billustrations, maps ;c28 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

We develop powerful tests for the null hypothesis that the underlying mean is constant against very general alternative hypotheses. The proposed tests can be applied to test for any kind of change, whether it be abrupt or smooth. Nonparametric function estimation techniques are used in deriving these tests. The test statistics utilize a Fourier series smoother that minimizes an estimate of mean integrated squared error.  Estimating the underlying function is greatly complicated when the data are correlated. An important example of correlated data is that arising from a stationary time series. To obtain a valid test of mean constancy, it is necessary to estimate the spectrum of the error process. We consider various methods of estimating the error spectrum. We have found that, in the case of an AR(1) model, the spectrum is well-estimated if local linear smoothing is used in conjunction with generalized least squares.  A power study of the proposed tests is done by simulation when the errors follow an AR(1) model, and the tests are applied to a set of astronomy data. 4aMajor statistics. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aHart, Jeffrey D.,edegree supervisor.1 aCline, Daren B.H., degree committee member.1 aWehrly, Thomas E.,edegree committee member.1 aDeBlasse, R.

Such deep water records and their spectra are desirable as a means of characterizing the tsunami source. The closest thing to such a record is that of the March 1957 event recorded by Van Dorn at Wake Island, a small volcanic atoll in the West Pacific nearly surrounded by a complex chain of sea mounts. While not of the same trapping capacity as the Hawaiian Island or continents, Wake Island and its neighboring sea mounts can produce quasi-resonant responses for periods near 3, 5, 6, 9 and 14 minutes. This effect sufficiently distorts the signals near shore, at the Van Dorn wave gauge and at a tide well within the lagoon, that they are quite different from that in the deep water. An inverse method is discussed by which the deep water signal can be estimated by one gauge and checked by the other. This inverse method is employed to determine an estimate of the deep sea tsunami signal from the Van Dorn gauge. Unfortunately the independent check using the tide gauge was not possible because of the lack of reliable information on its dynamic response characteristics at periods in the spectral band for the tsunami event. 0aTsunamis. 0aIslands. 7aIslands.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00980104 7aTsunamis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01158379 4aOceanography 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aReid, Robert O.,edegree supervisor.1 aKlinck, John M.,edegree committee member.1 aNewton, Howard J.,edegree committee member.1 aRowe, Gilbert T.,edegree committee member.1 aWhitaker, Robert E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1034800zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746089131&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs7788f874-08e1-3dec-8724-344485458c0ciebb88890-639d-38b8-920a-939db4ebc30403417ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099003000180100002300210245012500233264001000358300004600368336002600414337002800440338002700468500002800495502005500523500001000578504005700588520153700645650003302182650003202215650002702247650002002274650002202294655002702316700004202343700004602385700004502431700004502476700004402521710005802565856007702623856015602700994001202856999007902868in0000074118520200904152405.0881220s1987    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm18929319  9ADH0623AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCOdTXA  a(OCoLC)18929319  aTXAM  a1987aDissertationaD74351 aDover, Barry Alan.10aHormonal basis for developmental arrest of last-instar Heliothis virescens larvae by Campoletis sonorensis polydnavirus. 1c1987.  axii, 112 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The polydnavirus which occurs in the reproductive tract of C. sonorensis (CsV) has several effects on the host independent of the presence of parasitoid eggs or larvae. The present study found that CsV disrupted the development of last-instar H. virescens larvae by suppressing host ecdysteroid titers. When injected in large doses, CsV caused total degeneration of the glands which was associated with the permanent suppression of host hemolymph ecdysteroid titers. Total gland degeneration, therefore, prevented pupation by the host. When host larvae were injected with lower doses, however, a dose-dependent proportion exhibited only partial degeneration of the prothoracic glands. These hosts were delayed in development and remained in the stage in which they were injected due to a dose-dependent period of suppressed ecdysteroid titers. After the period of suppression, ecdysteroid titers rose to normal levels and host development continued normally. CsV had little, if any, effect on surviving prothoracic gland cells. The number of surviving gland cells per larva was inversely related to both the mean size of the cells and the length of development by the larva after injection. Intact cells apparently compensated for the lost ecdysone production of degenerated cells. However, there seemed to be a maximum rate of production by intact cells, so that fewer cells took longer to elevate the host's ecdysteroid titers to normal levels. 0aHost-parasite relationships. 0aPlant virusesxHost plants. 0aHeliothisxPhysiology. 0aPlant hormones. 4aMajor entomology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKeeley, Larry L.,edegree supervisor.1 aVinson, S.

Sequential measurements in manufacturing systems and on-line measured signals in speech recognition systems can be well described by nonstationary models (e.g. piece-wise or quasi-stationary models). Multiple models are used for describing a nonstationary process behavior which may randomly switch from one model to another within a set of stationary models. The model orders and parameter values of the members are known initially and they are expanded by on-line model identification. Two novel methods are employed in the design of the proposed hybrid learning procedure: an adaptive segmentation algorithm and an adaptive neural network. The first method is developed for detecting a change in the underlying process model, while the second performs on-line model identification of the changed process. The design of the adaptive hybrid system consists of the following four components: (i) a bank of parallel filters (prediction neural sub-networks) constructed from multiple models, (ii) a model classification neural network, (iii) a sequential model change detection procedure based on an adaptive segmentation algorithm and (iv) the recursive least squares parameter estimation method. The objective of this research is to design an adaptive signal processing system for sequential monitoring of a quasi-stationary process; the primary concern is to detect the time of a change and to perform on-line model adaptation. Two significant contributions are provided: a development of a sensitive change detection procedure and a design of an efficient modular neural network for on-line processing of nonlinear and nonstationary time series. The proposed adaptive hybrid system may be thought of as an extension of the conventional multi-model approach. Here nonlinearity and nonstationarity axe approximated by quasi-stationary piece-wise linear, or piece-wise nonlinear models. Experimental results show that the proposed neural network approach is capable as an on-line learning system with a sensitive detection response in nonstationary environments. A manufacturing process change behavior can be effectively captured by the proposed on-line learning hybrid system. 0aNeural networks (Computer science) 0aAdaptive control systems. 0aSystem identification. 0aManufacturing processesxData processing. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aSastri, Tep,edegree supervisor.1 aColunga, Daniel,edegree committee member.1 aFoster, Joseph W.,edegree committee member.1 aPignatiello, Joseph J.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:932881941xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1483778zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747688491&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs5ef4112b-51e9-388b-8e84-1cef2b0cfacdif1bb4586-1295-34c1-be1c-1d17b23a207e01847ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100003300217245011400250264001000364300004600374336002600420337002800446338002700474504004100501500001000542502004100552500003000593650003200623650002800655650001300683650002700696610004300723650001900766655002700785700004400812700005100856700005200907700004700959710005801006856007801064856015601142994001201298999007901310in0000120800220200904152626.0941128s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31521992  9AGP4991AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)31521992  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaK261 aKeeble, Louis Joseph,d1966-12aA study of four-jet events and search for double parton interactions with the collider detector at Fermilab / 1c1992.  axix, 203 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Hankel approximation in special situations is investigated from the geometric point of view, and the AAK theory on Hankel operators on the unit disc is developed in a comprehensive way. On the other hand, an innovative method is introduced, by which equivalent relations among Hankel operators on the unit disc, on the half plane, and in integral form can be naturally established. Parallel results and the AAK theory on Hankel operators on the half plane and in integral form are then derived. Moreover, systems reduction and the problem of H^[infinity]-control are studied in terms of Hankel approximation. Minimum-norm Nevanilinna-Pick tangent interpolation are used to solve the H^[infinity]-control problem in multivariable stetting. Finally, truncated Hankel operators are introduced to facilitate the computation of best Hankel approximants, and results on the rate of convergence are obtained. 0aHankel operators. 0aApproximation theory. 4aMajor mathematics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aChui, Charles K.,edegree supervisor.1 aWard, Joseph D.,edegree supervisor.1 aChan, Andrew K.,edegree committee member.1 aLarson, David R.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913396441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1229770zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747613551&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2e3f8ac0-9be9-3904-acf1-8c36dabaea91if45522e4-4e04-3417-a363-ecda745b754e04132ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100002600223245009600249264001000345300004500355336002600400337002800426338002700454504004100481500001000522502004100532500004100573650003300614650001600647650002000663650004200683650003000725655002700755700004200782700005100824700004400875700004800919710005800967856016901025856007801194520214301272856015603415994001203571999007903583in0000123206620200904152655.0950424s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm32359367  9AGS2182AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)32359367  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaD6911 aDookwah, Hugh Denroy.10aStudies on the expression and modulation of gap junctions in rat myometrial cell cultures / 1c1993.  axv, 157 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

However, the availability of new molecular and biochemical tools including cDNAs and antipeptide antibodies permits extensive characterization of gap junctions. A myometrial cell culture system was developed for study of regulatory mechanisms governing gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). Primary myometrial cells, isolated by progressive enzymatic digestion of the uterine tissue were used to establish cell lines by serial passage and transfection with a pSV3neo plasmid. Steroid hormone assays by radioligand-hormone competition indicated that estrogen receptors were decreased in cell lines compared to primary cells. This limited the utility of cell lines. Primary cultures also expressed high levels of progesterone receptors. The smooth muscle origin of the cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence labelling for desmin, α-smooth muscle actin and myosin. Staining with antibody to α-gap junction protein confirmed the presence of connexin43 in these cultures. Functional and structural characterizations of GJIC were assayed by electron microscopy and a fluorescent recovery after photobleaching assay, gap FRAP. Contrary to the insitu uterus, cultured myometrial cells spontaneously formed gap junctions. Further, estradiol (10^-7M) increased GJIC, while progesterone only suppressed estradiol induced increases. Indomethacin treatment indicated that prostaglandins increased GJIC. In vivo, cAMP and its analogs decrease myometrial GJIC, in contrast, increases in GJIC was observed in cultured myometrial cells. Using a paradigm in which octanol was used to reduce GJIC to low levels, application of cAMP and its anologs caused rapid increases in GJIC. Similar results were obtained with SIGC and Clone 9 cells which also express connexin43. The rapidity of modulation by cAMP, within minutes, suggests gating of channels by phosphorylation. TPA induced protein kinase C was inhibitory on GJIC. An antipeptide antibody to a sequence of a-gap junction protein was produced, but proved ineffective for immunofluorescence..41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747728451&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs6058ae4d-d20a-3a68-adfc-78404c96a632if484b027-7fc9-30df-8c81-e047362dd51d02915ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100003600197245013100233264001000364300004600374336002600420337002800446338002700474504004100501500001000542502004100552500004300593520109100636650003201727655002701759700004201786700004901828700004801877700005201925710005801977856015602035856007802191856013302269994001202402999007902414in0000127106520200904152731.0960125s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34085785  9AGW4000AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34085785  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaK2931 aKellerman, Scott Joseph,d1968-10aDetermination of thermodynamic properties of natural gas mixtures by direct and indirect methods /cby Scott Joseph Kellerman. 1c1994.  axii, 195 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The measurements spanned the supercritical, vapor, liquid and two-phase regions from 200 to 450 K and up to 23 MPa. Thermodynamic properties, UHAGS, also were derived from the PT data along with second and third virial coefficients. Phase boundary conditions were determined for each isochore that entered the two-phase region. At 10.34 MPa, enthalpy increments for pure n-heptane, pure methylcyclohexane, two n-heptane +methane mixtures, two methylcyclohexane +methane mixtures, one n-heptane +methane +methanol mixture and one methylcyclohexane + methane +methanol mixture were measured with a thermoelectric flow calorimeter from 180 K to 320 K. For each mixture, these measured enthalpy increments were combined with additional enthalpy information to calculate total enthalpy values relative to the pure fluids as edeal gases at 0 K. 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHolste, James C.,edegree supervisor.1 aMarsh, Kenneth N.,edegree committee member.1 aPloehn, Harry J.,edegree committee member.1 aWilhoit, Randolph C.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741325031&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1514690zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741325031&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffsb4526567-5d65-3937-970b-00d82f14ffd9if5077037-f1be-3b97-bf08-81f37cb5a8e103952ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002800189100002200217245007300239264001000312300004600322336002600368337002800394338002700422500002800449502004100477500001000518504004100528500004500569520211800614650004202732650004502774650005102819650003402870655002702904700004302931700004702974700004603021700004403067710005803111856007803169856015603247994001203403999007903415in0000111235020200904152547.0921023s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm26846084  9AFU7037AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)26846084  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaE121 aEarles, Jessie A.10aIntelligent tutoring system design for engineering science courses / 1c1991.  axii, 116 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Reviewing the current educational engineering software, two major deficiencies surfaced: (1) a method for integration into the classroom was not identified and (2) an instructional model was not used in the development process. This indicated a clear need for a science-based design approach founded upon the cognitive sciences and educational research. In taking the science-based approach, the organization of knowledge and use of different learning styles are identified as two important factors that affect the students' learning and hence the design of the ITS. Input from the faculty to identify key problem areas in classroom learning of engineering science courses was obtained through a survey. These results were used in developing an instructional model for the tutoring module. Fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, and vibration courses were examined for commonalities and differences in approach and a knowledge structure developed for each. These were then generalized to form a basis for the knowledge base. A simple yet effective student model is proposed. This strategy forms a basis for the proposed ITS design. The system design was implemented using LUCID's Symbolic Programming Environment which is an integrated package including LISP, flavors, and a window toolkit. The framework implementation was demonstrated on two fluid mechanics examples and one solid mechanics example. The issues addressed include supplementary needs of the engineering science classroom, hardware and software concerns, identification of key attributes adequate to define a problem, choice of knowledge representation scheme(s), development of an educationally-based tutoring strategy, and implementation issues such as the formalization of the problem solving process. In conclusion, the framework is a viable means of providing supplementary tutoring for the engineering science courses. However, more development work and testing is necessary to produce a classroom product. 0aIntelligent tutoring systemsxDesign. 0aEngineeringxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aObject-oriented programming (Computer science) 4aMajor mechanical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aNiedzwecki, J.

Because virtually every aspect of the economy was controlled by the government during those years, its trade and development policies have been credited with creating both the greatest industrial expansion and the worst economic crisis in its history. The methodology employed to assess the structural changes in manufacturing is based on the transcendental logarithmic production function which explicitly measures the marginal productivities and elasticities of output with respect to labor, capital and material inputs. In addition, this methodology provides an empirical measure of total factor productivity (TFP), or increase in output not accounted for by increases in factor inputs. The results indicate that TFP contributed negatively to the production process, declining 1.02 percent while growth in output was in excess of 31 percent. The marginal productivity and contribution of capital declined 6.15 percent and 12.12 percent, respectively, more the result of a decline in capital return than from reduced investment. The contribution of labor declined 2.57 percent owing to a 29.75 percent reduction in real wages, as employment grew 55.96 percent. Increases in the prices of material inputs caused its share in the value of output to increase 5.56 percent while the marginal productivity grew a modest 0.12 percent. Trade orientation had no detectable effect on TFP due to relatively insignificant changes in trade performance. Exports grew in real terms but remained a small part of total output (5.3 percent in 1985). Import substitution grew 22.0 percent but imports accounted for only 7.8 percent of domestic use in 1985. Government trade and development programs were primarily responsible for the over-all decline in productivity but not for the variations in TFP among the sectors. Efforts to promote productivity though control of technology transfer, investment, ownership, and financial incentives proved ineffective against extensive protectionist measures and currency controls. These actions provided an anti-export bias and a disincentive to investment in technology. 4aMajor urban and regional science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKolari, James,edegree supervisor.1 aPugh, David,edegree supervisor.1 aEtter, Wayne,edegree committee member.1 aSweeney, Donald,edegree committee member.1 aZardkoohi, Asghar,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1523647zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745532091&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs756171fb-531d-37fa-b54f-128eabbf0f10if624d200-8773-39ec-82e1-70c6eb83f69604237ctm a2200481Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151043001200171049000900183099002900192100003200221245008400253264001000337300002800347336002600375337002800401338002700429500002800456502004100484500001000525504004100535500003000576520225200606650002602858651004902884650001902933655002702952700004002979700004703019700004603066700004403112700004703156710005803203856016903261856007803430856015603508994001203664999007903676in0000101659020200904152534.0910806s1990    xx       bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24182502  9AFE9815AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)24182502  an-us---  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaS6331 aSligh, Robert Bruce,d1957-10aPlowshares into swords :bthe decision to mobilize the National Guard in 1940 / 1c1990.  aix, 240 leaves ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The National Guard was a force, although partially equipped and trained, that could augment it. The Army quickly won presidential approval to increase both the Guard's size and its training, but not to the levels the Army wished. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was hesitant to take too large a step for the largely isolationist populist. The Army, too, moved cautiously in its efforts to train and reorganize the National Guard. The National Guard Association represented the Guard's officer corps and possessed one of the most effective lobbies at that time. It had long sought an increased national defense and funds without incurring substantial Federal control. From 1939 through 1941, the Association, at the behest of Milton A. Reckord, its able lobbyist, set aside its concerns over Federal control, if only briefly, and cooperated with the Army, but only if the Federal government paid for more troops and equipment. While the Association attempted to balance its state and national concerns, Congress grappled with the political costs of mobilizing citizen soldiers. Isolationists in particular faced the dilemma of strengthening national defense and restricting the growth of presidential power. Public Law 96 passed in August 1940 provided for the mobilization of the National Guard for one year, but restricted its use to US possessions and the Western Hemisphere. In 1941 Roosevelt requested Congress to retain Guardsmen, Reservists, and draftees. While retention of the Guard was not in serious doubt, it was tied to keeping draftees beyond one year. Passage of retention legislation by one vote denoted the nation's division over the nation's possible evolvement in the war. The Acts of 1940 and 1941 tested the National Guard as an instrument of national defense and expanded the Federal government's powers over the Guard. Federalized units served as training grounds for draftees and effective combat units. Mobilization brought another result. Congress had expanded its power to use the Guard as a Federal reserve force, effectively removing it from the state' hands, a point finally clarified in 1990 by the Supreme Court. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945. 0aUnited StatesxNational GuardxMobilization. 4aMajor history. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aHill, Larry D.,edegree supervisor.1 aBeaumont, Roger,edegree committee member.1 aCarlson, David,edegree committee member.1 aHall, Claude,edegree committee member.1 aKrammer, Arnold,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:911831341xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1174826zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=746143251&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs5d4ad9b8-ab15-37f5-a3f8-c9261550ff7bif66ecf13-91a5-3a2e-93fb-b3f457aa417c03556ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003100218245009000249264001000339300004700349336002600396337002800422338002700450500002800477502004100505500001000546504004100556500003300597520177000630650002002400650002902420650002002449650002202469655002702491700004702518700005002565700004902615700005102664710005802715856007802773856015602851994001203007999007903019in0000107492420200904152601.0921002s1991    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm26713804  9AFR7133AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)26713804  aTXAM  a1991aDissertationaR2331 aRatcliff, Shannon Lacelle.13aAn examination of workplace justice, attitudes, and behavior :bthe case of layoffs / 1c1991.  axiii, 153 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Self-report survey instruments were used to collect longitudinal data from victims and cross-sectional data from survivors. The study was conducted in an organization that was undergoing a staff reduction. Correlational analyses revealed that procedural justice was positively related to fairness perceptions for layoff victims and survivors and that distributive justice was also positively related to fairness perceptions for layoff victims. Perceptions of interpersonal justice and organizational commitment were positively related to job satisfaction for layoff victims and survivors. Justice perceptions were also found to be related to organizational commitment. Procedural justice was positively related to commitment for layoff victims and survivors. Interpersonal justice was also positively related to commitment for victims. In a counterintuitive finding, distributive justice and organizational commitment were negatively correlated for layoff victims. Procedural justice and organizational commitment were positively related to victims' willingness to recruit for former employer, while only organizational commitment was significantly related to survivors' willingness to recruit for the employer. Justice perceptions were not related to survivors' turnover intentions. An individual difference variable, self-efficacy, was found to significantly influence victims' willingness to recruit for the former employer and job satisfaction. Strengths and weaknesses, managerial and practical implications of the study, and suggestions for future research are discussed. 0aLayoff systems. 0aOrganizational behavior. 0aSocial justice. 4aMajor management. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aYoungblood, Stuart A.,edegree supervisor.1 aSamuelson, Charles,edegree committee member.1 aSchoenfeldt, Lyle,edegree committee member.1 aWoodman, Richard W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1250375zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744871551&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs2c522e97-165f-3532-94ce-ea730b4f8ac6if7adbade-edb3-3ef9-9778-b1b54401072d03877ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005100109035002000160049000900180099002900189100003200218245015000250264001000400300004700410336002600457337002800483338002700511504004100538500001000579502004100589500006300630520195000693650002402643650003602667650002002703650004402723650005202767655002702819700004202846700004802888700004702936700005302983710005803036856007803094856015603172994001203328999007903340in0000120799820200904152629.0941128s1992    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm31521990  9AGP4987AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCFdTXA  a(OCoLC)31521990  aTXAM  a1992aDissertationaM4661 aMay, Gregory DeWitt,d1965-10aRegulation and evolution of the patatin multigene family :bsuggestions of combinatorial interactions directing tissue-specific gene expression / 1c1992.  axiii, 135 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Questions also arise about how new regulatory elements are integrated into the complex physiology of new tissues. To examine these questions, the patatin multigene family was used as a model system. Patatin is a family of lipid acyl hydrolases that accounts for 30-40% of the total protein in potato tubers. The Class-I genes, which produce the majority of the patatin protein in tubers, can also be induced to express at high levels in stems and leaves by 0.2 -0.3 M sucrose. However, under normal conditions, they are almost totally tuber-specific. To examine how "tuber-specific" genes could have evolved from regulatory elements in non-tuberizing species, the expression of the endogenous patatin genes in tomato and tobacco were compared to that of potato Class-I patatin promoters using transgenic plants. Patatin promoters were also isolated and characterized from tobacco and evolutionarily divergent species of wild potato. These promoters contain sequences characteristic of both the Class-I and Class-II patatin genes. However, their patterns of expression are unlike those of any previously reported patatin genes. They were neither sucrose inducible nor tuber-specific and were wound-inducible, unlike potato Class-I patatin genes which are turned off by wounding. Because the major soybean vegetative storage protein (VSP) serves similar roles in soybeans to that served by patatin in potatoes, vsp promoter expression in transgenic potato plants was also examined. Although vsp is normally expressed in soybean leaves, it was tuber-specific when introduced into potato plants. Like Class-I patatin, vsp could be induced to express in leaves by sucrose, but unlike patatin, vsp could also be induced by methyl jasmonate, systemin and oligourinides... 0aGenetic regulation. 0aPotatoesxGerm-plasm resources. 0aPlant proteins. 0aPotatoesxDevelopmentxGenetic aspects. 4aMajor plant physiology and plant biotechnology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPark, William D.,edegree supervisor.1 aCobb, D.

Polyuridylic acid has been selected as the model for this study due to its relatively well characterized radiation chemistry and its similarity to DNA, the critical radiation target of the cell. Free radicals attack the uracil and ribose sugar by forming adducts with the base or by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the sugar moiety. The adducts are called intermediate radicals which will either release a hydrogen molecule or a water molecule to become the original base or they will abstract a hydrogen from the sugar moiety o f an adjacent nucleotide. The abstraction o f a hydrogen from the sugar moiety is assumed to be followed by a strand break and a base release. Only the free radicals *OH, H* and which are produced by radiolysis o f water play important role in causing damage to biomolecules. Previously performed irradiation experiments with DNA model systems, such as poly(U), are simulated in complete detail by a Monte Carlo computer code, namely OREC and RADLYS. OREC is the code for the transport of electrons through water. RADLYS simulates the prechemistry and early chemical stage of electron track development. These codes were modified to simulate the radiolysis of poly(U) in aqueous solution. In this dissertation, detailed discussions are given o f the modifications to the OREC and RADLYS codes for the simulation and the development of poly(U) as a molecular model for radiation damage to biomolecules. The 60Co Gy(E) values for strand break and base release are determined to be 1.77 and 2.00, respectively. If the radius of the cylinder is halved and length increased four times, the corresponding 60Co Gy(E) values are 2.35 and 2.75, respectively. The latter set of data displays a close agreement with those obtained experimentally by von Sonntag (1987). Detailed discussions on the comparisons of the calculational and experimental data are presented in this report. Simulations under other irradiation conditions are also reported. 0aMicrodosimetry. 0aRadiation dosimetryxData processing. 0aRadiationxToxicology. 0aBiomoleculesxEffect of radiation on. 4aMajor nuclear engineering. 7aMicrodosimetry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01019728 7aRadiation dosimetryxData processing.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01086928 7aRadiationxToxicology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01086905 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBolch, Wesley E.,edegree supervisor.1 aPetty, Frederick C.,edegree committee member.1 aPoston Sr., John W.,edegree committee member.1 aGiedroc, David P.,edegree committee member.1 aMcLain Jr., Milton E.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1503567zLink to OAKTrust Copy41uhttp://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741326531&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 0 OTHER HOLDINGSffs13fe25bc-9fa1-3cb0-a5e6-e2a92f6ec35bif8b39187-f681-30c0-a88b-e57bf6fc9f7703462ctm a2200457Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002900194100003000223245011300253264001000366300004600376336002600422337002800448338002700476500002800503502004100531500001000572504004100582500004500623520148700668650002702155650002402182650003402206655002702240700004202267700004202309700005202351700004902403710005802452856016902510856007802679856015602757994001202913999007902925in0000101655920200904152538.0910717s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm24090389  9AFE9784AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)24090389  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaW8761 aWood, James Ralph,d1956-13aAn investigation of the effects of variance components on the performance of job shop dispatching policies / 1c1990.  axii, 241 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

First, to investigate the impact of unequal processing time variances on overall shop performance. Second, to implement strategies for improving job shop performance by designing priority dispatching policies that include measures of system statistical variability. The approach is through a statistical- experiment in which processing time variances, at specified machines, are systematically increased while holding processing means constant. The job shops modeled herein deviate from mainstream research which traditionally assumes that processing times are known prior to the implementation of the priority rules. Instead, this study examines a stochastic environment in which operation processing times are random variables from mutually independent probability distributions. It is assumed that the only information available for jobs waiting for service, are their operation processing time distribution. Hence, the priority dispatching policies examined herein are based solely on means and variances instead of exact information. A capstone of this research is the development of four new priority dispatching policies that include components of system variability. In simulated cases these four rules are compared against five commonly studied dispatching rules. The results indicate that that the four variance inclusive rules perform as well or better than the five traditional dispatching rules, in every criterion measured. 0aProduction scheduling. 0aProduction control. 4aMajor industrial engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aPhillips, Don T.,edegree supervisor.1 aSmith, Donald R.,edegree supervisor.1 aGarcia-Diaz, Alberto,edegree committee member.1 aNewton, H.

The 4 x 2 factorial experiment involved eight duplicated treatments consisting of four levels of weed control and two waterlily cultivars. Treatments included a no-weeding control, 2 manual weeding, 1 and 2 grass carp per 52.5-m^2 experimental pen. Initial and monthly densities of aquatic weed biomass, species composition, number of hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata Royle) turions in soil core samples, and upper surface leaf areas and total number of flowers produced per waterlily plant were measured in each pen until complete weed control occurred in both grass-carp treatments. Generally, biomass of aquatic weeds differed significantly among weed-control treatments. Weed biomass in the manual-weeding treatment was lower than in all others soon after initiation of the experiment; in both grass-carp treatments, weed reduction was evident only after winter. Diversity of weed types was very low during the experiment, and succession occurred with changing seasons. Hydrilla was dominant at the beginning of the experiment and watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) near termination. Hydrilla turions in soil increased in fall, and decreased in spring and summer. The competitive effect of weeds on the growth of waterlilies was clearly seen in the latter part of the experiment, with significantly greater leaf areas in the manual-weeding, 1-carp pen^-1 and 2-carp pen^-1 treatments over the control. Following weed elimination, some grass carp ate waterlilies; whereas, others did not. A systems model was developed to simulate the effect of grazing by grass carp on the dynamics of weed biomass in a shallow water body in south Texas. Fish growth was a function of assimilation and metabolism. The model was parameterized using available information from the literature and results of the field experiment. It predicted that a stocking density of 110[plus or minus]7 grass carp ha^-1 (vegetated) would be required to reduce vegetation to 40% of its maximum biomass in the second summer. Two selected management schemes were simulated to estimate the grass carp density necessary to achieve continuous vegetation control at the 40% level. 0aAquatic weedsxBiological control. 0aCtenopharyngodon idella. 0aWater liliesxWeed control. 4aMajor wildlife and fisheries sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aStrawn, R.

Subsequently, empowerment is formally defined as a process in which a more powerful actor, A, makes resources available to a less powerful actor, B, that would otherwise be unavailable, actor B uses those resources, and change results. A theoretical model based on this definition is developed which specifies that resources are made available through the implementation of any or all of five empowerment strategies by agents of empowerment. The validity of these ideas is explored in a study of shelters for battered women. Multiple methods are used to assess manifestation of empowermment strategies and change experienced by residents. The data indicate that all five empowerment strategies are implemented, and that shelter residents experience both structural and developmental change. Issues relating to changes in the theoretical model as a result of the study are discussed, and suggestions for future research are given, along with propositions and hypotheses to guide that research. 0aAbused womenxRehabilitationzUnited States. 0aControl (Psychology) 7aAbused womenxRehabilitation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00794894 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 4aMajor sociology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aZey, Mary,edegree supervisor.1 aGrider, Sylvia,edegree committee member.1 aMcIntosh, Alex,edegree committee member.1 aSell, Jane,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913396741xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1229784zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747387601&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs74f82732-08ab-3bda-b794-b71cbcb932a9ifba22394-dce8-3310-b300-b512b0836b2d03274ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035001400072035002000086035002300106040003000129049000900159099002900168100003200197245008400229264001000313300004500323336002600368337002800394338002700422500003100449500001000480502004100490504004100531520161100572650002002183655002702203700004802230700004702278700004602325700004802371700004902419710005802468856015602526856007902682994001202761999007902773in0000127217420220103134919.0960222s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  9AGW7880AM  a(OCoLC)34245202  a(OCoLC)ocm34245202  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaA2361 aAdkins, Ronald Mark,d1967-10aEvolution of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene in primates and rodents / 1c1993.  axi, 145 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Major subject: Genetics."  aVita.  bPh.

Among primates these phylogenetic conclusions were supported: (1) tarsiers are sister to monkeys and apes, (2) the aye-aye is sister to a group containing all lemurs and lorises, (3) dwarf lemurs are more closely related to other lemurs than to lorises, and (4) the ring-tail lemur is sister to gentle lemurs (Hapalemur) rather than to other members of the genus Lemur. COII was inappropriate for addressing most systematic questions among rodents. In comparisons among orders of mammals, COII supported the monophyly of Chiroptera, in contrast to restricted claims that one suborder of bats is more closely related to primates. Relationships among orders could not be determined with a reasonable degree of confidence. In agreement with previous genetic studies of nuclear gene sequences, COII appeared to be evolving more rapidly in rodents than in artiodactyls. However, this difference was not statistically significant. COII and cytochrome c interact during respiration and both have been found to be evolving very rapidly in higher primates, where the COII gene has presumably undergone a change in conformation. The period of accelerated evolution was found to coincide with the origin of higher primates (monkeys and apes). The cytochrome c gene also underwent a period of rapid evolution during this period. These results suggest coevolution between a mitochondrial (COII) and nuclear (cytochrome c) genetic system. 4aMajor genetics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBickham, John W.,edegree committee member.1 aDavis, Scott K.,edegree committee member.1 aHoneycutt, Rodney L.,edegree supervisor.1 aJacobs, Louis L.,edegree committee member.1 aWoolley, James B.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=744951171&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to ProQuest copy41uhttps://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1518275zLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsab9f7c5c-0720-3bd4-8d5c-ea6de6812cd2ifcaa43d7-57a5-3f4b-a710-657875a624c403798ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100002900209245008100238264001000319300004600329336002600375337002800401338002700429504004100456500001000497502004100507500004300548520198200591650003202573655002702605700004502632700004702677700005102724700004902775710005802824856016902882856007803051856015603129994001203285999007903297in0000128771820200904152706.0960329s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34490739  9AGX7145AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34490739  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaG4111 aGhaeli, Hooshang,d1955-10aSelective alkylation of toluene with methanol over pentasil-type catalysts / 1c1993.  axii, 166 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

A relatively high cost is associated with obtaining it in 99+% purity. Purification of para xylene requires separation from three close boiling C8 aromatics i.e. m-xylene, o-xylene, and ethylbenzene and subsequent isomerization of the remaining ortho and meta xylene isomers to an equilibrium mixture. The removal of ethylbenzene is another source of complication. To study the effect of acid sites in pentasil-type catalyst on the toluene alkylation, and para xylene selectivity, four catalysts with different cations in the frame work were synthesized. These catalyst were synthesized to have a SiO2/M2O3=70, where M is Al, B, Fe, or La. X-ray diffraction patterns of these catalysts indicated that all of these catalysts have a pentalsil-type structure. The results of temperature programmed desorptions (TPD) of ammonia indicate that A1ZSM-5 and FeZSM-5 have three different acid sites, weak, medium and strong. The TPD of ammonia of BZSM5 and LaZSM-5 showed a fourth type acid site. The effect of temperature, residence time, and feed composition on alkylation of toluene with methanol over these catalysts were studied. The A1ZSM-5 produced a xylene composition comparable to the equilibrium composition. Alkylation of toluene with methanol over BZSM-5, FeZSM-5, and LaZSM-5 produce xylene composition different than the equilibrium one. The LaZSM-5 catalyst produced the highest para xylene selectivity. The para xylene composition in the xylene isomers was as high as 92%. The p-xylene isomerization over A1ZSM-5, and LaZSM catalysts, indicate that the minimization of the isomerization reaction is the cause of the high para selectivity. All of the catalysts used in this investigation showed relatively rapid deactivation. The cause of the catalyst deactivation is the coke formation inside of the catalyst pores. 4aMajor chemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aAnthony, Rayford G.,edegree supervisor.1 aAkgerman, Aydin,edegree committee member.1 aClearfield, Abraham,edegree committee member.1 aGadalla, Ahmed M.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941077841xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1526970zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745760081&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs88888abb-250c-314d-8d69-fa3e99fdc94bifd1e435c-be37-309d-9c66-1c0d9414f15704265ctm a2200445Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099003000180100002600210245007000236264001000306300004700316336002600363337002800389338002700417504004100444500001000485502004100495500003400536520237000570650002302940655002702963700004802990700004303038700004303081700004503124700004803169700005003217710005803267856016903325856007803494856015603572994001203728999007903740in0000130081020200904152732.0960516s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34743521  9AHA3293AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34743521  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaL78331 aLiu, Changhai,d1962-10aTheoretical and numerical studies of organized convective lines / 1c1994.  axvii, 278 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

A hierarchical generalization of dynamic models is made by adding more realism and by introducing a distinct overturning-type jump updraft. The basic form of the momentum flux profile displays a striking similarity in the models. Shear in the jump inflow and baroclinic vorticity generation only alter the detailed shape of the momentum flux, but they have significant influences on selecting convective regimes. Based on the 22 and 23 June soundings during COPT81 experiment, a series of simulations are conducted with a two-dimensional version of the non-hydrostatic cloud model. Two distinct mechanisms associated with the generation of convective cells are identified: the cold outflow forcing from decaying cells and the initiation by gravity waves. The role of ice microphysics depends on environmental conditions. For the case of strong convective instability, ice impact is important to the system-scale structure but not essential to the convective-scale dynamics. On the other hand, in the situation of weak convective instability, ice effect is crucial to reproduce the observed storm. There is a profound universality in the vertical flux of line-normal momentum in the simulations. The archetypal model is capable of replicating the shape of the line-normal momentum flux reasonably but underestimates the amplitude. The application of the buoyant-type model considerably improves the momentum-flux prediction. The eddy transport is almost independent of the shear in both the initial and domain-averaged wind profiles. In contrast, in the line-parallel direction the eddy transport behaves largely in a down-gradient sense. The Schneider-Lindzentype formulation fails to represent the line-normal momentum flux but predicts the along-line momentum flux well. An idealized model is constructed to examine the density current in non-conservative fluids and sheared environments. It is shown that the incorporation of a stable stratification enhances the depth and propagation of density currents; the opposite behavior is found in buoyant fluids. In a sheared environment the density current deepens and moves faster if the shear changes from negative to positive. 4aMajor meteorology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMoncrieff, Mitchell W.,edegree supervisor.1 aZipser, Edward J.,edegree supervisor.1 aChang, Ping,edegree committee member.1 aDjuric, Dusan,edegree committee member.1 aNorth, Gerald R.,edegree committee member.1 aStewart, Robert H.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:943272141xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551969zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900191&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs1562b31f-2d4a-3f22-b4b4-b92b4e359b05ife20e95a-e15e-3d20-911d-3d97619e001b04330ctm a2200553Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040006300109035002000172043001200192049000900204099002900213100002500242245009300267264001000360300004400370336002600414337002800440338002700468500002800495502004100523500001000564504004100574500005400615520196200669650004302631650002502674650002802699650001302727650004402740650004602784651003702830651005302867650004302920655002702963700004602990700004203036700004803078700004903126700004903175710005803224856016903282856007803451856015603529994001203685999007903697in0000099827420200904152525.0910121s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22990334  9AEY7924AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)22990334  an-us-tx  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaM3371 aMarin, Mirna,d1944-10aRelationship of epipelic algae populations and shrimp culture at Corpus Christi, Texas / 1c1990.  axi, 88 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

Diatom blooms are often stimulateded, to increase productivity in ponds; at the same time, mariculturists may try to control cyanobacteria blooms because of toxic effects. Use of Solricin 235 and Simazine to control cyanobacterial growth in shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) culture ponds was evaluated. Solricin treatment significantly reduced cyanobacterial density (as measured by C-phycoerythrin concentration). Simazine treatment did not reduce cyanobacterial densities. Neither treatment significantly affected physicochemical parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH), nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicate) dynamics, chlorophyll concentrations or shrimp survival and growth. Natural ingestion of diatoms by P. vannamei postlarvae in relation to supplementary feed was evaluated. Diatom genera, cell condition (full and empty), and number were determined in shrimp guts and fecal pellets. For the first time it was demostrated that P. vannamei postlarvae grazed actively on epipelic diatoms, especially before feed was applied to the system. Postlarvae showed selectivity in diatom grazing and utilization, with Nitzschia and Navicula being the principal taxa utilized. The impact of shrimp postlarval culture on the temporal dynamics of planktonic and epipelic diatom assemblages in raceways was evaluated through grazing exclosure studies. Diatom communities were dominated by the epipsammic species Synedraulna, and four epipelic species Navicuia stundlii. Amphora coffeaeformis. Nitzschia socialis, and Nitzschia #1. The four epipelic species were selectively grazed by shrimp postlarvae. Epipelic diatoms may contribute significantly to postlarval shrimp production. Further research is needed on the interactions of shrimp postlarvae and A. coffeaeform is A this epipelic diatom is a domoic acid- producing form that may cause shrimp mortality. 0aShrimp culturezTexaszCorpus Christi. 0aMarine algaezTexas. 0aCyanobacteriaxControl. 0aDiatoms. 7aMarine algae.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01009356 7aShrimp culture.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01117783 7aTexas.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01210336 7aTexaszCorpus Christi.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204275 4aMajor wildlife and fisheries sciences. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLawrence, Addison A.,edegree supervisor.1 aMurphy, Brian R.,edegree supervisor.1 aFicht, Thomas A.,edegree committee member.1 aFryxell, Greta A.,edegree committee member.1 aStrawn, Robert K.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:902724441xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1117140zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747347761&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsb5c332ab-41af-3735-955b-c2de3aba4b35ife34dff9-2473-3649-86db-9f40a97423bb04294ctm a2200517Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165043001200185049000900197099002900206100002500235245007900260264001000339300004400349336002600393337002800419338002700447500002800474502004100502500001000543504004100553500004500594520207100639650005102710650003802761650001902799650006202818651004502880650003402925655002702959700004202986700004503028700005003073700004703123700005403170710005803224856016903282856007803451856015603529994001203685999007903697in0000099824520200904152535.0910115s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22965035  9AEY7894AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)22965035  an-us---  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaT1691 aTanyeri-Abur, Aysen.13aAn agricultural sector analysis of the United States sugar import policy / 1c1990.  ax, 119 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

This policy, while supporting U.S. producer prices and incomes at a high level, has caused consumers to pay more for sugar and has reduced the incomes of foreign sugar producers. It has also stimulated domestic sugar production along with development of sugar substitutes such as High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) which contributed to the fall in sugar demand. The quota policy has been criticized by previous economic studies and in the GATT trade negotiations. This study extends previous analyses to look at effects of sugar policy changes from a total sector perspective. The study of potential sugar policy reform was done using a mathematical programming sector model. Substitution between HFCS and sugar in sweetener using industries was explicitly modeled. A baseline scenario was constructed and validated using 1986 data which was then compared to alternative policy runs where: (i) the sugar quota was removed, and (ii) a target price was implemented. Comparisons were made with and without farm program provisions for the other sectoral commodities. The results show differing implications in the sugar industry as compared to the agricultural sector. Quota removal raised the welfare of domestic sugar consumers and foreign sugar producers but resulted in a lower welfare level for domestic sugar producers. Welfare for the rest of the society increases with the removal of the quota only if distortions arising from farm programs are eliminated. In the farm program runs, both the removal of the quota and the imposition of target prices resulted in a lower net social welfare compared to the case with the quota. Acreage substitutions towards other crops result in a social welfare loss because of increased government payments. This result provides an empirical example of the theory of the second best as the costs of other distortions outweigh the sugar gains. However, when farm programs for the other crops are eliminated, quota removal results in an increase in net social benefit. 0aSugar tradexGovernment policyzUnited States. 0aSugar tradexMathematical models. 0aImport quotas. 7aSugar tradexGovernment policy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01137440 7aUnited States.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204155 4aMajor agricultural economics. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aMcCarl, Bruce A.,edegree supervisor.1 aBaye, Michael,edegree committee member.1 aCheng-Chang, Ching,edegree committee member.1 aKnutson, Ronald,edegree committee member.1 aPeterson, E.

A group of proteins known as heat shock proteins (HSPs) are synthesized in response to heat stress and are thought to enhance cellular thermotolerance. Because gene expression begins at variable developmental stages in post-fertilization embryos, early stage embryos may not synthesize heat shock proteins. The hypothesis states that heat shock proteins are not present in the early embryo, thus embryos are susceptible to hyperthermic conditions. In order to detect heat shock gene transcription in a limited number of embryos at early embryonic stages, we developed a 1-tube polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based protocol that minimized RNA loss and enhanced sensitivity of transcription detection. In this protocol, embryonic gDNA was cleaved between primer sites with DNAase; endogenous RNAases were inhibited with a RNAase inhibitor; and RNA integrity was maintained with E. coli rRNA. Samples were reverse transcribed to form cDNA which was then amplified with PCR. The 1-tube protocol was used to synthesize cDNA from mRNA transcripts which were transcribed from a heat inducible heat shock protein gene from murine embryos. Transcripts from HSP 70.1 were detected during the first four days of gestation in murine embryos. The 1-tube protocol was also used to identify the presence of mRNA transcripts from two bovine genes, HSP 70.1 and 70.4. In these studies, two developmental stages were evaluated in the bovine: prior to the 8 to 16-cell stage (3-5 cells) and at 12-16 cells. Heat shock protein 70.1 transcripts appeared during the 12 to 16-cell stage in both control and heat shocked embryos. Transcription was detected from HSP 70.4 before the 8 to 16-cell stage in both control and heat shocked embryos. However, by the 12 to 16-cell stage, only the control embryos synthesized HSP 70.4 mRNA transcripts. We concluded that the 1-tube protocol was sensitive and allowed detection of both murine and bovine heat shock transcripts during early, thermolabile developmental stages. Detection of HSP 70 transcripts at the earliest stages of development suggests that HSP 70 gene expression may be necessary but was not sufficient to protect embryos from thermal stress. 4aMajor veterinary physiology. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aKraemer, Duane C.,edegree supervisor.1 aCollisson, Ellen,edegree committee member.1 aKochevar, Deborah T.,edegree committee member.1 aPeterson, David,edegree committee member.1 aTiffany-Castiglioni, Evelyn,edegree committee member.1 aWomack, James,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:941077941xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1526024zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745768651&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs99585e36-6886-321b-baff-0a4feaea835cifec544f3-4415-3dd1-86e0-6a133fc2401b03041ctm a2200541Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040007700109035002000186043001200206084001800218049000900236099002900245100003200274245014200306264001000448300004500458336002600503337002800529338002700557500002800584502004100612500001000653504004100663500004500704520067700749650004301426650003501469650004401504650001801548651003301566650005001599651004101649650003401690655002701724700004801751700005001799700004401849700005401893710005801947856016902005856007802174856015602252994001202408999007902420in0000099497420200904152527.0901105s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm22634609  9AEX8775AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdDEBBGdOCLCQdOCLCOdUMIdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCAdTXA  a(OCoLC)22634609  aa-io---  aRR 609862rvk  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaM9841 aMursidi, Tyas Rudito Sigit.10aAttitudes of small-scale fishermen in Pangandaran, Indonesia toward selected governmental programs, the occupation of fishing, and risk / 1c1990.  axi, 108 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The population of 979 small-scale fishermen in Sub-district Pangandaran, Ciamis, West Java, Indonesia were studied from May 1989 to August 1989. A sample of 126 fishermen consisting of small (< 10 gross tons) boat owners and workers on boats was chosen using stratified random sampling. Data were collected through personal interviews. Attitude scales were constructed using factor analysis. Cronbach's [alpha] values were calculated and ranged from 0.64 to 0.94. 0aFishersxGovernment policyzIndonesia. 0aFisherszIndonesiaxAttitudes. 7aAgrarsoziologie2gnd0(DE-588)4073988-007aFischer.2swd 7aJava2gnd0(DE-588)4028527-3 7aFishersxAttitudes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00926175 7aIndonesia.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01209242 4aMajor agricultural education. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aChristiansen, James E.,edegree supervisor.1 aHerring, Donald R.,edegree committee member.1 aLarke, Alvin,edegree committee member.1 aPeterson, E.

A series of experiments focused on analysis of an unusual nuclear distribution of the oncogene products T-antigen and p53 in an SV40- transformed cell line, DC3. Antibodies to T-antigen and p53 were used in conjunction with morphological and biochemical approaches to explain the nature of these antigens in DC3 cells as compared to COS-1, an established SV40-transformed cell line. Approaches included indirect immunofluorescence, double immunolabelling, cell cycle analysis, confocal microscopy, immunogold electron microscopy, nuclear fractionation, Western blot analysis, and DNA transfection of SV40 genes into both primary granulosa and DC3 cells. The results suggested that the unusual distribution of T-antigen and p53 in DC3 cells appears to be characteristic of interphase and is probably not due to gross structural alterations in either protein. A second series of experiments focused on developing a series of cell lines representative of progressive steps in the multistep process of malignant transformation. Primary granulosa cells and a spontaneously immortalized cell line, SIGC, represented the normal state and an intermediate step in transformation, respectively. Several morphological and functional properties of SIGC were evaluated with respect to those of normal granulosa cells. Cell lines further in the transformation pathway were generated by transfecting SIGC with pSV3neo and from tumor explants of transfected cells from a nude mouse. A dye transfer technique showed that progressive stages of transformation were correlated with a progressive loss of gap junction mediated cell-cell communication. The results of this study suggest that the in vitro transformation model system consisting of several cell lines derived from ovarian granulosa cells may be useful for studies of the fundamental nature of transformation in cell types other than those of fibroblast origin. These studies include using DC3 cells for investigation of novel functions of T-antigen, and SIGC cells for transfection or infection with other oncogenes in order to investigate the impact of their expression on cell-cell communication and other growth properties in an epithelial model system. 0aCarcinogenesisxAnimal models. 0aAnimal models in researchxRats. 0aOvariesxCell lines. 0aCancer cellsxGrowthvRegulations. 4aMajor veterinary anatomy. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aBurghardt, Robert C.,edegree supervisor.1 aStoica, George,edegree committee member.1 aTiffany-Castiglioni, Evelyn,edegree committee member.1 aWilson, Van G.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:902727741xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1117122zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747346511&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs3ab78fca-98c1-3c16-8523-60ce4452337biff5867bd-1b68-3fd9-8176-0a56c31fe40f04226ctm a2200469Ia 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040005600109035002000165049000900185099002800194100002600222245005600248264001000304300004700314336002600361337002800387338002700415500002800442502004100470500001000511504004100521500004300562650002100605650002900626650002000655650003200675655002700707700004400734700004900778700005100827700004900878710005800927856016900985856007801154520227701232856015603509994001203665999007903677in0000099747020200904152539.0910329s1990    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm23354251  9AEZ1741AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdUMIdTXA  a(OCoLC)23354251  aTXAM  a1990aDissertationaZ721 aZimmerman, William H.10aKinetic modeling of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis / 1c1990.  axiii, 233 leaves :billustrations ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aTypescript (photocopy).  bPh.

The model accounts for the formation of paraffins and olefins up to an arbitrary carbon number, and disappearance rates can be calculated from known stoichiometry. Equilibrium adsorption was assumed for CO, CO2, H2, and H2O, and accounts for product and reactant inhibition on rates. There was no significant difference in model results using a steady-state adsorption model and an equilibrium model, but the equilibrium model has the advantage of requiring fewer kinetic parameters. The final model requires 8 constants for Fischer-Tropsch, plus additional constants for water-gas shift kinetics (one in this study). Three types of reactors were considered: gas phase stirred tank and fixed bed (plug flow) reactors, and a stirred tank slurry reactor. The gas phase stirred tank is a simple, well defined reactor used in the model development, while the fixed bed reactor was chosen to represent the common laboratory fixed bed. The slurry reactor is another common laboratory reactor, but the reaction occurs on catalyst in the liquid phase formed by condensing the high molecular weight products of the reaction. Vapor-liquid equilibrium with simultaneous chemical reaction was used to account for the condensation. Non-Schulz-Flory distributions were obtained in the slurry reactor simulations due to olefin readsorption followed by chain growth. Higher concentrations of the high molecular weight olefins in the liquid phase cause the non-Schulz-Flory behavior. The adsorption also gives the trend of decreasing olefin content with carbon number expected from experiment. Both of the gas phase reactors (fixed bed and stirred tank) exhibited nearly classical Schulz-Flory distributions under most conditions. In the fixed bed, conversion increases along the length of the reactor, which leads to changes in selectivity with position. The integral effect of the selectivity profiles causes some carbon number dependence on α and olefin content, but the deviations from classical distributions are significant only at low carbon numbers...41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745132921&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs94c25d97-225d-36d6-9400-6853645523b1iff84b5af-9771-3768-ba00-c7873043312303999ctm a2200397Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072040004400095035002000139100002300159245009300182264001000275300004600285336002600331337002800357338002700385504004100412500001000453502004100463500004700504520234200551650003602893655002802929655004702957700004003004700004303044700004803087700004803135710005803183856015603241856007803397994001203475948003503487999007903522in0000130051220200904152731.0960515s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34737076  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXAdOCLCOdOCLCF  a(OCoLC)347370761 aLan, Yubin,d1961-10aFissure characteristics related to moisture adsorption stresses in rice /cby Yubin Lan. 1c1994.  axix, 180 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Rice kernels were initially conditioned to three equilibrium relative humidities (ERH) of 46, 62, and 80%, and then were exposed to high relative humidity (RH) environments of 65, 86, and 100% for different periods. All experiments were conducted at 21$\sp\circ$C. Results showed that grains equilibrated to 46 and 62% ERH would fissure when exposed to either 86 or 100% RH. For rice grains at 46% ERH, the cumulative percentage of fissured kernels (CPFK) increased as the exposure humidity increased with all of the kernels fissuring at 100% exposure humidity. The CPFK decreased sharply as the initial moisture level increased with no kernels developing fissures when rice grains at 80% ERH were exposed to 86 and 100% RH. The cumulative number of fissures (CNF) in rice grains increased with exposure RH and exposure time.  The retardation times were analyzed by using the experimental values and finite element techniques. The moisture adsorption rates (MAR) for different forms of rice and RH were determined. The experimental results were compared with the finite element analysis. The moisture gradients in a rice kernel during moisture adsorption were calculated.  The causes and characteristics of rice fissures from moisture stresses were investigated. The finite element method was used to obtain numerical solutions to the moisture diffusion equation and stress-strain relationship equation. Therefore, two finite element models were derived from the mathematical analysis. The first model solved the moisture diffusion within the rice kernel while the second simulated the internal expansion and contraction of the kernel and evaluated the magnitude of the local strains and stresses.  The three major stress components, namely axial, radial, and tangential stresses were studied in relation to failure tensile strength and local strain energy density of distortion by the finite element program. Axial stresses are the primary reason for fissures to develop in a rice kernel; tangential stresses may cause a rice grain to fissure parallel to the longitudinal axis; radial stresses do not cause a rice grain to fissure. The largest tensile stresses occur at the center of a kernel where the fissure usually starts. 4aMajor agricultural engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aKunze, Otto R.,edegree supervisor.1 aSweat, Vincent E.,edegree supervisor.1 aSuter, Dwayne A.,edegree committee member.1 aRooney, Lloyd W.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=740900181&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust Copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1551668zLink to OAKTrust copy  aZ0bTXA  hHELD BY TXA - 0 OTHER HOLDINGSffs8c473d9a-8db0-3f08-9d27-142e2de9d4aaiffadeda3-009e-37ab-8048-87e8c4ee0cbb03824ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040004200109035002000151049000900171099002900180100003500209245012800244264001000372300004400382336002600426337002800452338002700480504004100507500001000548502004100558500003300599650002200632655002700654700004200681700005200723700005200775700004900827710005800876856016900934856007801103520197401181856015603155994001203311999007903323in0000127562520200904152722.0960411s1993    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34551968  9AGY1279AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdUMIdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34551968  aTXAM  a1993aDissertationaR8831 aRowlands, Justin Craig,d1965-10aAntiestrogenic and antimitogenic effects of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD) :bin vitro mechanistic studies / 1c1993.  ax, 151 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

The estrogen receptor (ER) positive hum an ovarian carcinoma cell lines PE01, PE04 and PE06 expressed the Ah receptor with properties similar to the AhR from other human cells. However, TCDD-induced P450IA1 mRNA levels, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity and an AhR-DRE complex only in the PEO4 cells. 17β-Estradiol (E2) stimulated PEO4 and PEO6 cell proliferation and the E2-induced cell growth was suppressed by TCDD in both of these cell lines. These data show that TCDD exhibits antiestrogenic activity in ER-positive ovarian carcinoma cell lines which is not dependent on P450IA1 induction. The antiestrogenic and antimitogenic activity of TCDD was investigated in the E2 responsive MCF-7 hum an breast cancer cells. TCDD suppressed E2-, IGF-1-, Insulin-, E2 plus IGF-1- and E2 plus Insulin-induced cell proliferation. The steady-state mRNA levels for the ER and IGF-1 receptor were not effected by TCDD or any other treatments. However, TCDD inhibited E2-induced pS2 mRNA steady-state levels and the constitutive expresion of HER -2/neu receptor mRNA steady-state levels were suppressed after TCDD-treatment. TCDD-inhibited or suppressed E2-induced expression of immediate early oncogenes c-myc and c-fos and TPA and E2-induced AP-l-TRE binding. Alternatively, treatment of MCF-7 cells with TPA-inhibited TCDD-induced AhR-DRE binding and expression of Fos oncoprotein suppressed TCDD dependent AhR transactivation of a CAT reporter gene in both MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells. Moreover, in Hepa 1c1c 7 cells, Fos and Jun inhibited the formation of a TCDD-dependent AhR-DRE complex and AhR was precipitated with Fos antibodies. These results were consistent with the formation of a nuclear Ah receptor-Fos complex and support a novel mechanism to explain some fo the antimitogenic and antiestrogenic effects of TCDD.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=745760491&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffsd91c3063-8a26-3b88-8259-3e19e770492biffdcae48-f68c-34c3-a621-fb532063b5a7
