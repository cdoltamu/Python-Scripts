The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) observed in the generation of Ch3 radicals exhibited a dependence on the residence time in the post-reaction zone. Metal oxides differ greatly with respect to their reactivities with Ch3 radicals. Oxides in which the cations exhibit accessible multivalent oxidation states are highly reactive. The reactions of CH3 radicals with these metal oxides are believed to take place via a mechanism in which cations are reduced as a result of the electron transfer from CH3 radicals. The reactions are characterized by small activation energies and sticking coefficients that result from either electron-tunneling or a direct electron transfer which is limited by the weak adsorption of CH3 radicals. The methoxide ions that are produced ultimately form CO2 and CO via formate ions. The addition of Na2CO3 to La2O3, CeO2 and Tb2O3 has marked effect on the catalytic properties of these materials. The effect is most dramatic for CeO2, which, upon addition on Na2CO3, is transformed from a total oxidation catalyst to a reasonably selective catalyst for the formation of C2+ hydrocarbons. A sodium carbonate/oxide phase largely covers the lanthanide oxide surface. Accordingly, the Na/Ln[x]O[y] catalysts are similar to pure Na2CO3 with respect to their catalytic properties. The sodium compound inhibit reactions between CH3 radicals and the underlying metal oxide and provide a new active species, Na2O2. The active and selective NaMnO4/MgO catalyst also was partially covered with a sodium carbonate/oxide phase. Two phases may be responsible for the good performance of the catalyst: a crystalline phase of the structure of Mg6MnO8 and a sodium phase on the surface. The formation of the former is promoted by the presence of Na+ ions. The role of the sodium phase is the same as in Na/Ln[x]O[y] catalysts.","Ph.

Since a broadband network has a high bandwidth-delay product, preventive resource managem ent schemes have to be designed to ensure th e probability of network congestion being held below a certain value. Despite preventive schemes, network congestion may still occur due to aggregated and focussed loads. Hence, an adaptive m angem ent scheme should be designed as a compliment to preventive schemes. Admission control is used as a preventive scheme which decides w hether or not to accept a connection upon its request. A m ajor undertaking in the design of such a scheme is the com putational complexity, and an admission control scheme has to make a trade-off between its time-complexity and accuracy. In the Average Renewal Cycle model, the average behavior of the traffic stream in its renewal cycle is formulated, based on which an upper bound on the cell loss probability is obtained. The Resource Decomposition model utilizes the performance model of each individual source in isolation to infer its behavior in a multiplexed traffic stream. The proposed approaches have an advantage over the existing ones in th at they have higher accuracy but almost equal processing overhead. Moreover, the second model can be applied to different cell discarding schemes, which cannot be done in any of the existing approaches. To protect th e transmission quality of information sources in the face of link overload, we propose and evaluate a burst-level adaptive resource m anagem ent scheme. Our scheme reacts to overload situations in an output port by reallocating the resources of the port among th e active sources. Since the network congestion is mainly caused by burst-level traffic fluctuations, the proposed scheme is shown to be effective in protecting the service quality of information sources. The ATM network is developed to support a large variety of application systems. The interplay between the ATM network and these systems is critical for their development. As a case study, m edia synchronization schemes in a distributed m ultimedia systems are examined. We quantify and analyze the correlation between the synchronization quality and the ATM network to provide an insight into the the interplay between th e ATM network and the distributed multimedia system.","Ph.

An outline view is a form of hierarchically organized hypertext whereby information can be expanded and contracted dynamically to show varying levels of detail. Unlike other user interface models for structured information systems, the model developed provides a single paradigm for performing all major information system tasks. These tasks include adding, editing, browsing, querying, and reporting.  The outline view model presented by this research is generic; it can be applied to any kind of information that can be modeled as an entity-relationship structure. This includes relational, hierarchical, network, and object-oriented data models as well as many hypertext data models. This contribution is especially significant because it supports the deployment of information intensive applications with very little custom development effort. Given only the entity-relationship schema as input, an implementation of the outline view model would provide a complete information system interface.  The user interface model is evaluated with usability testing. The primary goal of the usability evaluation is to determine the major usability problems related to specification of an outline view from a structured information schema. This is accomplished by an observational evaluation of ten subjects with a prototype implementation of the outline view model. In addition, usability data is provided by the performance statistics collected by the prototype including task time, error rate, and sequence of operation. The usability evaluation identified nine primary usability problems over the ten subjects. Overall usability of the model is very good based on the short learning time, low error rate, correctness, and subjective ratings of the evaluation subjects.","Ph.

The code generated absorbed fractions of energy for monoenergetic electrons for selected source organs. The organs or regions considered were those with high surface to volume ratio, organs with walls, and organs that have subdivisions. The calculated absorbed fractions for electrons supersede the values specified by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) methodology. New estimates of S-values for eighty radionuclides were calculated using the new electron absorbed fractions for 21 combinations of source-target regions. Revised S-values were compared with those presented by MIRD Pamphlet No. 5 Revised. An assumption used in the calculation of S-values was the use of the average energy of the 8 spectra rather than using the full spectra. A study was carried out to assess the limitations of using the average energy of the beta spectra. This assumption was studied by generating electron absorbed fraction profiles for different beta decaying radionuclides in small sphere volumes. Absorbed fractions were calculated using their beta average energy and their full spectra. The use of average beta energies overestimates the absorbed fraction in source region over small volumes. The overestimation is dependent on the beta spectra of the radionuclide. A relationship was found between the absorbed fraction (AF) in source region and the surface-to-volume ratio of the region (S/V). The relation is independent of the geometry of the source region; consequently, there was a unique relation between absorbed fractions of energy in source region and (S/V) ratio tor every radionuclide studied. The EGS4 code was used to calculate absorbed doses to the circulatory system. Absorbed doses per transformation per cm3 delivered to the blood and blood vessel walls for specific radionuclides were calculated for different blood vessel sizes. Absorbed doses to both the blood and blood vessel can be calculated for any radionuclide given the blood vessel radius. This model can be applied to any organ vascular system to assess the dose to tissue and blood.","Ph.

Genetically stable years for genetic parameters estimation were determined by ANOVA and testing for differences between years (P<.01). Data utilized for genetic parameter estimation included the years 1959 to 1985 with 6017 ewes mated to 293 rams. EBV was attained by modifying a standard EBV equation for repeated measures, improved by the use of repeatability and heritability estimates for number of lambs born within each age group. Heritability estimates increased linearly from age 2 to 7 yr (.30, SE =.10 to.64, SE =.20), except for age 5 yr (.41, SE =.08), suggesting an age or parity effect on gene expression. Frequency of multiple births increased between the ages of 2 and 6 yr (4.7 to 21.0%). Selection of twin born ewes over single born as breeding replacements was suggested by their higher frequency of multiple births (35.8 vs 33.6) and number of lambs born to age 8 yr (8.4 vs 8.0), without any significant negative effect on fleece weight (P<.01). No freemartin effects on twin born ewes were observed on pre- and postnatal growth for birth weight, fleece weight, number of lambs born and body weight (P<.05). Fleece weights decreased as the number of lambs reared increased: 4.2, 4.0, 3.9 and 3.8 kg for ewes with 0, 1, 2, 3 lambs, respectively. The genetic correlation between fleece weight and the average number of lambs born was $-.18$. The relationship of a ewe's body weight to lamb production was identified as curvilinear with lighter and extremely heavier ewes having lower rates of reproduction. A body weight range of 54.5 to 64.0 kg was found to have the highest frequency of multiple births and average number of lambs born. Selection for mature breeding weight could be accomplished with a high degree of accuracy at the age of 3 yr (.88). A genetic correlation of.26 was derived for average breeding weight and average number of lambs born. Longevity was not influenced by birth type of the ewe (P<.05). Longevity decreased significantly (P<.01) as the average number of lambs born and fleece weight increased.","Ph.

However, no ""perfect"" TLD phosphor has been discovered due to the rigid constraints that must be met, such as energy independence, low fading rate, sensitivity, ability to measure neutron dose, etc. Because facilities can have several different radiation fields based on radiation type and energy, it can be a challenge to measure accurately the dose under all normal exposure scenarios. In addition, the medical field uses TLD's in a variety of circumstances where it would be advantageous to have a dosimeter type that can be used in different radiation fields with minimal adjustments to the analysis process. Thermoluminescent dosimeter elements based on a mixture of TLD phosphors in powder form have been investigated to determine the possible advantages that mixtures may offer. The mixture under study has been shown to be stable chemically, and experimental results indicate that photon energy independence has been achieved from 20 keV to 662 keV. Also, the beta radiation response per unit absorbed dose for the mixture was determined to be approximately 0.8 times the response per unit absorbed dose for 662 keV photons. In addition, the thermal neutron response of the mixture for a fluence of 3.6x10^10 n/cm^2 was measured to be approximately 600 times the response per rad for 662 keV photons.","Ph.

The multistage model is currently the most widely used cancer dose-response model. Several characteristics of the multistage model iterative estimation procedure are derived; namely, the concavity of the likelihood function, the use of Akaike's information criterion to select the degree of the model, the derivation of initial parameter estimates, and the use of Kuhn-Tucker conditions as stopping criteria. Current dose-response models including the multistage model have limited biological rationale and tend to greatly oversimplify the carcinogenic process. To incorporate more science into the cancer dose-response models, Sielken (1987) proposed a new family of models. The lognormal is an important part of these new models. To make the new models more tractable, approximations and alternatives to the lognormal density are proposed. Often there are problems in choosing between the lognormal distribution and the normal distribution. Hypothesis testing procedures based on the likelihood ratio test for these two non-nested families are suggested and examined. In a large scale simulation study, the critical values and corresponding powers of the suggested procedures were obtained. Some of the consequences of assuming normality when the underlying distribution is lognormal are determined and illustrated.","Ph.

Mite reproduction was examined from cohorts of infested honey bees of known age dissected at regular intervals over four seasons. Duration of mite reproduction paralleled host longevity. Mites reproduced and progeny dispersed over a short duration (35 days) prior to the death of short lived bees (<40 days) in spring and summer. Longer lived winter bees harbored immature mites for the majority of the 120 days over which they were sampled. Numbers of mites peaked when bees were ca. 24 days old regardless of eventual host longevity. Oviposition by daughter females within the same host was revealed. A model of mite reproduction was developed to evaluate hypotheses of a second, or partial second generation of mites. The hypothesis of a complete second generation was supported when bees were infested with a low initial foundress mite population (one mite/bee), and lived 45-80 days. The alternative hypothesis of a partial second generation was supported by data from short lived bees, in which oviposition by daughters was limited. No oviposition by daughters was apparent when more than 2-3 foundress mites occupy a tracheal tube. Two foundress mites per tracheae may be the maximum for optimal reproduction. Resource deterioration limiting mite reproduction may involve physiological aging of the host, deterioration of the tracheal wall from mite feeding, or other unknown factors. The effects of methoprene (a mimic of host juvenile hormone) on mite reproduction were examined and no effects were evident. Dispersal by mated foundress's daughters to new host bees was a random process. Mite dispersals at night were eight times greater than corresponding daytime mite dispersals. No increases in daytime mite dispersals were observed when comparing confined and free flying infested bees of foraging age from the same colony. Host bees were physically less active at night, perhaps influencing the nocturnal dispersal pattern of mites. Mean flight times of infested and uninfested worker bees were not significantly different. The longevity of infested worker bees was slightly less than uninfested siblings.","Ph.

The approach describes both a methodology, called EVIDENCE, and a complementary software tool. The EVIDENCE methodology provides a set of steps and guidelines for gathering, interpreting and applying end-user data to refining a software prototype. The software support tool integrates evaluation information, including video-recordings and related structured annotations, into a software development environment. Together the methodology and supporting software improve the ability of small development teams to efficiently learn from end-users during iterative design. The approach fills a methodological gap in the software engineering field. Detailed results are presented through an extended case study. The case study involved two design cycles for a moderately complex graphical design environment. Results from six end-user sessions are presented. Complete transcripts and summary results produced according to the methodology are provided in appendices. In the case study, the first iteration identified 32 end-user problems and implemented design solutions to nine problems. The second iteration identified 64 problems, 32 of which were selected for implementation. EVIDENCE prescribes a simple rating system for the user impact of problems and a classification system for proposed solutions. A new concept of ""implementation depth"" is introduced for classifying solutions. Classification by implementation depth gives an indication of how fundamental a design change is and guides the search for more fundamental changes where practical. The research describes a software design and prototype to capture and manipulate information developed while applying EVIDENCE. The software design provides a simple but adequate data model. The prototype shows how a user interface can provide convenient access to the evaluation information through workstation software. This approach to software support coupled with the EVIDENCE methodology shows how the technological marriage of computers and television can be harnessed to provide more user-centeredness in a software development environment.","Ph.

More precise nutritional information about this forage-based system should facilitate its management for crawfish production. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the nutrient composition of rice during decomposition, to determine the gross trends in biomass of associated microorganisms and their effect on crawfish growth, and to estimate the contribution of separable fractions of available food resources to crawfish growth. A three-part approach was undertaken to address these objectives. In part one, preboot rice (variety Mars) underwent aerobic decomposition at 22.5[plus or minus]1.5°C with pond water and soil for various intervals of time. Nutrient profiles (ash, crude protein, crude lipid, cell-wall content and C:N ratio) of rice and its products of decomposition varied according to plant portion and decomposition time. In general, decomposition decreased crude lipid content and C:N ratio while ash, cell-wall and protein contents increased over time. The second part of the research consisted of a series of feeding experiments in a flow-through tank system to assess the contribution of single feedstuffs to growth of juvenile crawfish (Procambarus clarkii) housed individually. The ability of juvenile crawfish to use plant components for growth was limited, compared with their ability to use a prepared feed (Dupont's Crawdeaux[TM]); and, their ability to use detritus varied directly with the total biomass of associated microbes. The last part of the research focused on crawfish growth in static-water microcosms with and without various components of the detrital food chain and the prepared feed. The growth data were used to fit a multiple linear model with zero intercept to estimate contribution to growth from separable components of the treatments. These were--in order of importance--prepared feed, microbially-enriched detrital forage, soil benthos, soil substrate and possibly meiofauna and larger organisms associated with detritus.","Ph.

If a nation is to remain unified, the citizens of that nation must share common values, goals, and ideals. That the school should serve as an agent of dissemination of those common values has been a recurring theme of reform movements throughout the past century. The multiple values demanded of the school system by numerous interest groups has forced administrators to ask which of those roles is most important. Lacking national consensus, administrators look to local constituents for guidance. This research examined three high schools in the United States to determine the ways in which socialization for democratization takes place. The examples included a rural high school in the Texas hill country, a suburban high school in a suburb of Seattle, Washington, and an urban high school in Charlottesville, Virginia. This sample represents diverse geographic areas as well as diverse populations. Based on the naturalistic method of inquiry, the study reveals the similarities and differences among the three schools in their socialization practices. It also reveals that administrators, faculty, and students consider it important that the school fulfill its role of providing students the opportunity to become a well-educated informed citizenry in order to preserve the democratic system of government in this nation. Though they use different methods and emphasize different democratic principles, the three schools examined do fulfill their role of socialization for democratization.","Ph.

In an attempt to determine why West African sorghums display low yield potential, 7 converted guinea, 4 zerazera, and 2 caudatum sorghums were crossed to three improved A-lines. Parents and hybrids were evaluated for general and specific combining ability at Halfway and College Station, Texas during 1989 and 1990. In general, non-guineas were better combiners than guineas for yield and most yield components. Guineas showed low additive effects for grain yield, seeds/panicle, and seed size. This could be explained by the stability of grain yield of guineas over a wide range of environments. Guineas seem to maintain a relative low yield by reducing the number of seeds/panicle and seed size. Most guinea hybrids showed positive heterosis over the best parent for yield. This indicated that guineas possess some genes or factors contributing to higher yield expression. In general, the guinea hybrids had more primary branches/panicle, more whorls/panicle, greater panicle length, and more exsertion than non-guinea hybrids. Guineas showed some specific combining ability. The principal component analysis indicated that the first component was a measure of yield and yield components, while the second component described architecture of the plant. The best yielding cultivars were non-guinea combinations. Although guinea hybrids showed lower yield, some heterotic response for grain yield existed. For yield and plant architecture, zerazera was found to be related to caffrorum and caudatum. Caudatum and caffroum were less related to conspicuum (guineas). Diversity was found between conspicuum and caffrorum, caudatum, and zerazera. Evolutionary, conspicuums apparently evolved differently from these latter groups. During their evolution, adaptation, and stabilization guineas accumulated primarily genes or factors which contributed to stability of grain yield and to such traits as hard grain with resistance to mold, weathering, and insect damage rather than genes that contributed to high yield. However, contrary to some belief of sorghum scientists, there appears to be breeding value in guineas with regard to improvement of grain yield and related traits.","Ph.

Subjects were problem drinkers on probation for two or more DWI offenses, and nonproblem drinkers were those on probation for offenses other than DWI with no prior problem drinking or substance abuse history. Examination of ethnicity and drinking status effects using two-way analysis of covariance indicated no significant difference in MAC-R mean scores among the three ethnic groups; however, problem drinkers obtained significantly higher MAC-R mean scores than nonproblem drinkers. Evaluation to determine the MAC's ability in classifying problem drinkers from nonproblem drinkers was conducted by dividing the sample into an estimation sample (n = 180) and a cross-validation sample (n = 90). The estimation sample was used to examine classification accuracy of various cutting scores by determining overall hit rates, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power (PPV), and negative predictive power (NPV). Modest discriminative validity was obtained on cutting scores from 23 to 27; however, a cutting score of 26 achieved the best hit rate (62.2%) with optimal balance between sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. Application of the five cutting scores from the estimation sample to the cross-validation sample resulted in relatively little validity shrinkage, but because only modest validity was obtained in the estimation sample, the decline was of sufficient magnitude that none of the cutting scores achieved hit rates greater than chance. Item analysis of the 49 MAC-R items revealed that significant ethnic differences in response patterns occurred on Items 387, 407, and 422 for problem drinkers and Items 69, 82, 202, 299, and 407 for nonproblem drinkers.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the separate and combined effects of clenbuterol (CB) and interval training on running performance and myosin light chain (LC) isoform expression in mouse skeletal muscle. Mice were randomly assigned to one of four treatm ent groups: 1) control (CON), 2) exercise (EX), 3) drug (CB), or 4) exercise+drug (EX+CB). CB and EX+CB mice were given CB (1.6 mg/kg) orally 4 days/week. EX and EX +C B mice were trained 4 days/week on a motorized treadmill (3 sets of 3 min, 36-40 m/min, 6-10° grade, 30 s recovery). Exercise performance was determined before and after 8 weeks o f treatment with a run-to-exhaustion test. Following 8 weeks of treatment, exercise conditioning increased total work (58%), while clenbuterol decreased total work (25%) on the treadmill. The simultaneous application of both treatments did not cause significant changes in work after eight weeks of treatment. Comparisons between treatments at the post-study exercise test indicated that the CON, CB, and EX +CB were not significantly different from each other, whereas, the EX group exhibited markedly greater exercise performance than the other groups. Gel electrophoresis indicated that neither the separate nor combined treatments promoted any changes (p>.05) in fast and slow myosin LC isoforms. Although not different from each other after 8 weeks, CB and EX+CB treatments produced greater values than CON for the following variables: muscle mass (25-34%), total protein (17- 50%), and myofibrillar protein (26-81%). There were no differences between EX and CON animals for any of these morphological variables. It was concluded: 1. Interval training enhances exercise performance without quantitatively altering total or myofibrillar protein contents. 2. Clenbuterol may decrease work indirectly by promoting muscle hypertrophy. 3. The adaptations in exercise performance are not a consequence of qualitative changes in the expression of myosin LC isoforms. 4. The combination of the two treatments have antagonistic effects on total work, while the two treatments do not interact to diminish the muscle-specific anabolic effects.","Ph.

Swarming was a predominantly male behavior. Swarming behavior was limited to certain locations, usually above objects which contrasted with the background. Swarming begins at specific times at dusk and dawn depending on the illumination levels and thus the sun angle at the sites of swarming. Swarming of Ps. columbiae males usually began approximately 40 m after sunset and the swarming behavior of this species is similar in many respects to that of Aedes sollicitans and other mosquito species. Psorophora columbiae swarming behavior was preceded by a mass ascension of mosquitoes from their pre-swarm resting places in vegetation. Male Ps. columbiae in marker swarms were sensitive to sounds of 200 to 500 Hz. Mating was not definitively observed in a swarm; however, it is likely that mating occurs near the sites of swarms and close to the time of swarming. Beetles as well as other mosquito species were associated with Ps. columbiae swarms. A technique developed by Schlein and Gratz (1972) to determine the ages of Anopheles mosquitoes was not accurate for Ps. columbiae. A remote-piloted flying sampler vehicle successfully captured flying mosquitoes and chironomids. A model for prediction of the initiation of swarming behavior by Ps. columbiae males in East Texas ricelands was developed. Prediction of mosquito swarms can be used as part of an integrated pest control strategy.","Ph.

This dissertation focuses on two central issues: (1) how are design concepts formed in response to the perception of problem needs and requirements in the conceptual design stage and (2) how can these concepts be represented and manipulated in a computer to provide the designer with effective automated support during conceptualization process? The first question is approached by an analysis of the cognitive skills needed in concept formation. Concept formation is a process used by designers to transform ill-structured problems into structural descriptions of a design. In this process, the designer individuates the perceived information into a set of perceived concepts. The perceived concepts are then categorized into concrete and abstract concepts depending on whether they correspond to image or non-image information (e.g., propositions). Finally, through association between concepts the interrelationships between concepts are formulated. The second question is approached by an analysis of the way the designer describes shapes in the design process. As a result of this analysis, a shape description process is proposed which supports the designer by providing a set of self-evident shape operations which is intuitive to the designer as well as executable in a computer-based design environment. These two major cognitive processes in conceptual design are identified as concept formation and shape description. The rationale for these processes was based on an examination of the cognitive processing activities required (1) to understand a design problem, (2) to realize the intended design by creating mental models of the design, and (3) to describe the mental models to the design environment. Shape conceptualization in design encompasses the design knowledge and cognitive skills of a human designer as well as the representation schemes and design tools supported by CAD systems...","Ph.

This work involves extending classical nucleation theory to include elastic and non-ideal solution effects. Laboratory studies characterize gas solubility/diffusivity in polymers and surface tensions of polymer with dissolved gas. Free expansion foaming studies characterize property, structure, and operating condition effects. The experimental studies were conducted on LDPE/HDPE samples, and mixtures thereof, using N2, Ar, and CO2 as the gas blowing agents. In addition, the effects of solid nucleating agents on the foaming process were also studied. With the cahn balance, the solubility/diffusivity data were obtained by thermogravimetric method and the surface tension by a Wilhelmy method over 250-350 °F and pressures upto 1800 psi. The free expansion foaming was conducted in a specially constructed high temperature/pressure cell. The final foam structure is largely governed by the bubble nucleation events which are affected by gas solubility, surface tension, and the presence of agents to promote heterogeneous nucleation. Viscous and elastic effects and the non-ideal mixing effects of gas-polymer solution tend to decrease nucleation. Highly non-ideal solubilities of gases in LDPE/HDPE increased with temperature unlike those observed in the low pressure Henry's law region. A modified Flory-Huggins theory represents the data quite accurately with a free parameter (interaction parameter). Gas diffusivity was insensitive to dissolved gas concentrations upto 120 ATM and increased slightly with temperature. The Wilhelmy method on the Cahn balance was found to be an effective method for measuring surface tension of polymer melts with dissolved gas. The surface tension of the LDPE-N2 decreases significantly with dissolved gas concentration. Such surface tension lowering is critically important to achieve efficient nucleation in foaming processes. Low density foams can be obtained using a high solubility gas and allowing the bubble growth state to mature before quenching. Very fine structures can be achieved with high bubble nucleation system. Significant bubble-bubble coalescence occurred which broadened the cell size distributions. In general these studies provide a number of insights into polymer foam processing mechanism.","Ph.

RuCl2(PTA)4 is an effective catalyst for the regioselective conversion of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols using a biphasic aqueous/organic medium with sodium formate as teh source of hydrogen, thus affording facile catalyst recovery and recycle. Both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes were reduced to the corresponding alcohols. The formate ion was shown to directly be the hydrogen source by deuterium labelling experiments. The rate of hydrogenation of benzaldehyde was found to be first-order in catalyst concentration, first-order in substrate concentration, and independent of formate concentrations >2.5M. The reduction process was greatly retarded by the presence of excess phosphine ligand. The apparant activation energy determined was 23.9 kcal-mol. A catalytic cycle was proposed which involves the rapid formation of a ruthenium hydride formate complex followed by phosphine dissociation and aldehyde addition in a slower step. Subsequent formation of a metal alkoxide intermediate and protoantion completes the cycle. Recycling experiments demonstrated the catalyst to be quite robust. A series of 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane complexes of group VI metal carbonyl complexes were also prepared.

The recorder gave charts of the force versus loading time for each specimen. These charts were used to obtain the dependent variables of 1) modulus of elasticity, 2) ultimate tensile, flexural and shear strengths and 3) specific shear energy, by appropriate equations and other observed data. A pendulum-type cutting apparatus with 1/8 and 1/16-inch thick blades was used to measure the specific cutting energy. Independent variables of 1) moisture content, 2) dry matter density, 3) rate of loading, 4) specimen location along the stalk and 5) blade thickness, were studied. Different levels of the independent variables were considered and a completely randomized block design involving factorial treatment combinations was used. Factorial analyses of variance were conducted and significant results were obtained.

Flow temperature and pressure conditions were those typically found in air-conditioner and heat pump applications. Effects of each operating parameters and short tube geometry on the flow rate were discussed and included in the modeling. Both an analytical and semi-empirical model were developed. These models allowed better prediction of mass flow rate and investigation of transport properties inside the short tube. Generally, the flow trends for both refrigerants were similar even though mass flow rate range for HFC-134a was 30 % lower than that for HCFC-22 due to lower operating pressure conditions. Within normal heat pump or air-conditioner operating conditions, second-stage choking (choking at the outlet) was only approximated because the flow showed a small dependency on downstream pressure. For the conditions investigated, the mass flow rate was directly proportional to upstream pressure and upstream subcooling, but it showed only a small dependency on downstream pressure. For two-phase flow entering the short tube, the flow rate decreased with increasing quality. The mass flow rate was found to be dependent on cross sectional area, chamfer depth, and short tube length. For subcooled liquid entering the short tube, the delay of flashing, i.e. metastable liquid flow, was observed at the inlet section of the short tube. It was observed that the effects of oil concentration on mass flow rate varied as a function of short tube geometry and upstream subcooling or quality. The semi-empirical flow model and flow charts for both single and two-phase flow were developed by empirically correcting the modified single-phase orifice equation to satisfy the short tube orifice flow. For both HCFC-22 and HFC-134a, the maximum difference between measured data and the model's prediction was within [plus or minus]10%...","Ph.

This approach permitted the prediction of the interactive residues involved in ligand binding and identification of molecular motifs that might be present in the biological sweet taste receptor. Competitive ligand binding radioimmunoassays, photoaffinity labeling and pH dependent binding experiments, site-directed mutagenesis studies and ligand induced fluorescence quenching experiments were used to determine the affinity, specificity and biophysics of the complexation. Computer-aided modeling using cDNA derived amino acid sequences for the heavy and light chain V regions of the antibodies was used to construct a three-dimensional model of the sweetener binding site. Based on these studies it was predicted that the following residues are involved in complexation: L:96 Tyr, H:33 Trp, H:96 Tyr, and L:32 Tyr form an aromatic box around the cyanophenyl ring, H:50 or H:35 Glu interact with the aryl-nitrogen, H:33 Trp is in contact with the ligand but does not involve a π-π stacking or charge-transfer interaction, and L:27[D] His and H:58 Arg also contact the ligand. Finally, the diphenyl rings of the ligand were predicted to point out of the binding site.

The objectives of this study were to develop technology for the production of interspecific diploid/tetraploid aggregate chimeras between Meriones unguiculatus (gerbil) and Mus musculus (mouse), and to use that technology to test the hypothesis that Mus musculus tetraploid embryos can support the fetal development of Meriones unguiculatus in the Mus musculus uterus. To develop methodology for the production and transfer of interspecific diploid/tetraploid aggregate chimeras, three areas were evaluated; 1. the use of rabbit antimurine whole serum antibody to immunosurgically isolate the Meriones unguiculatus inner cell mass (ICM), 2. the survival of Meriones unguiculatus blastocysts transferred to Mus musculus recipients and, 3. the implantation rates of Mus musculus tetraploid blastocysts transferred to Mus musculus recipients that were either 2.5 or 3.5 days post coitum (p.c ). The ICM of Meriones unguiculatus blastocysts were isolated by immunosurgery using rabbit antimurine whole serum. Meriones unguiculatus blastocysts did not survive to term in the Mus musculus uterus. Mus musculus tetraploid blastocysts transferred to Mus musculus recipients did not appear to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between recipients that were 2.5 or 3.5 days p.c. However, the implantation rates of those recipients that did contain implantation sites demonstrated a statistically significant (P<0.0005) higher rate of implantation in recipients that were 3.5 days p.c. Using the methodology developed and presented above, Mus musculus tetraploid 4-cell embryos were aggregated with either a Mus musculus or Meriones unguiculatus ICM, cultured 24 hours in vitro and aggregate blastocysts were transferred to 2.5 day p.c. Mus musculus recipients. One Mus musculus term fetus was produced from a diploid/tetraploid aggregate chimera, yet no Meriones unguiculatus term fetuses were produced. The survival of one intraspecific offspring demonstrates the tetraploid embryo's ability to establish and maintain the fetal-maternal interactions. However, the low rate of survival obtained in this study precludes conclusive assessment of the development of interspecific offspring by this procedure.","Ph.

The reasons for the decline in competitiveness and productivity in the design-construction industry, various solutions proposed to remedy the decline, and potential solutions available to reverse the decline are reviewed. The relationship between poor quality and declining productivity in the industry is analyzed. Statistical process control (SPC) theory as developed by Shewhart and Deming is reviewed. The most recent quality management theories, quality function deployment (QFD), and Taguchi Methods are reviewed. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of quality in current design-construction processes are developed using techniques from graph theory and Garvin's five definitions of quality. The possibility of utilizing statistical process control theory to improve the productivity of the existing design-construction process is explored. Quality function deployment concepts from manufacturing are rigorously reinterpreted for the design-construction process and a set of axioms which must be satisfied if the design-construction process satisfies all quality function deployment requirements are developed. Using these axioms, the existing design-construction construction process is then evaluated using QFD as a basis of measurement. Also using QFD as a basis of measurement, the relative improvements in quality and productivity to be gained are evaluated if: (a) the recent ASCE quality manual is implemented, (b) constructability is adopted, (c) new safety formats such as the LRFD Code are adopted, and (d) two prominent approaches to human error reduction and control are adopted. In addition to proposing a more robust approach to design and construction, this study also identifies several fundamental weaknesses in U.S. design-construction practices, namely the inability to: (a) accurately determine user requirements; (b) accurately establish target values to reflect these requirements; and (c) accurately transform these target values through design of components, fabrication of components, assembly of subsystems, and writing of specifications to reflect the fabrication and assembly.","Ph.

For (LWOCl2) + (L=N,N'N''-trimethyl-1,4,7=triazacyclononane complexes, only the 2A' state can be identified as a ground state. The 2A'' is an excited state and the orbital crossing mechanism cannot explain the occurrence of two stable isomers. For cis-mer-MoOCl2(PR3)3 complexes, the second-order Jahn-Teller effect is too weak to cause the bond-stretch phenomenon. Methane oxidative-addition to a transient RhCp(CO) complex involves an agostic-like intermediate in the early stage of the reaction with a metal-CH dative interaction. The transition state shows C-H bond breaking and is stabilized by the Rh-C and Rh-H dative bonding interactions. The second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation calculations predict an exothermic reaction with a reaction energy of 30.6 kcal/mol, an intermediate with a stabilization energy of 14.8 kcal/mol and an activation barrier of 4.1 kcal/mol relative to the intermediate.

The RHF calculations for the substitution by PMe3 on W(CO)4NOCl predict an associative mechanism with a 7-coordinate intermediate. The Laplacian of the total charge density displays a process in which electrons shift from the metal to the nitrogen, create an additional N lone pair and vacate a coordinate site for the entering ligand. Substitution by any PR3 on Re(CO)5Cl, however, proceeds by a dissociative or I[d] mechanism since the CO ligand cannot accommodate an additional electron pair.

This research describes the development of an invariant traffic sign recognition system capable of tolerating the above variations. The signs are restricted to three types of warning signs and are all of red color.  The procedure of the developed invariant pattern recognition system consists of three phases: (a) color image segmentation, (b) segmented image refinement, and (c) object recognition. In the color image segmentation phase, the proposed segmentation algorithm uses a partition and merge concept and the (u, v, h)-color coordinate system. A smoothing filter and morphological filters are used to refine the segmented binary image. The proposed smoothing filter is a nonlinear processing technique which is useful for filling little holes and eliminating small spots in an image. A unique combination of a centered polar-exponential grid, a Fourier transform, and a back-propagation network is used in the object recognition phase.  The developed recognition system is insensitive to brightness changes as well as invariant to translation, rotation, scale change, and noise. The architecture of this system is based upon neural network supervised learning after geometrical transformations have been applied. The proposed system is tested on a large number of signs with different positions, rotations, scale changes, and backgrounds.

Because studies indicated that crack propagation may also be important, the model was revised to include modified weakest link behavior in which the effects of propagation were included. Through the vehicle of statistics, micromechanics were used to predict the macroscopic properties. The revised model successfully predicted the trend toward higher than expected Weibull shape parameters. A three-parameter Weibull distribution was found to be an empirically effective approximation to the model and the data. The revised model was applied to the problems of nuclear pressure vessel design in the transition region, and to the problem of local brittle zones in weldments. A Master Curve was developed that was found to be a useful substitution for or complement to the ASME design curves. It successfully characterizes the distribution of cleavage fracture toughness data in the transition and lower shelf regions aim provides statistical tools for designers. An order statistics approach was developed for small censored data sets for which the master curve method was inappropriate. Predicting the toughness of weldments with local brittle zones was also made more difficult by the breakdown of weakest link assumptions.

In the metabolism study, a tritiated preparation of the trichothecene mycotoxin T-2 toxin was administered as a single oral dose to 21-day old male broiler (Hubbard x Hubbard) chickens and to the more sensitive male White Pekin ducks. At 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-administration, 3 birds of each species were killed and various tissues were collected, as was excreta at various times after treatment. To determine the amount of radioactivity in the excreta and tissues, samples were subjected to oxygen combustion analysis. There were no major differences between the 2 species in absorption, kinetics, metabolism, tissue retention or excretion of T-2 toxin and its metabolites. The 10-fold difference in toxicological sensitivity to T-2 toxin that exists between these 2 species could not be attributed to differences in the time course of metabolic detoxification or to differences in rates of excretion. To examine the toxicological effects of kojic acid and its possible synergy with aflatoxin, studies of male broiler (Peterson x Hubbard) chickens were conducted over a 21-day period beginning at day of hatch. In the toxicity study, 6 treatments of kojic acid at 0,.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 g kojic acid/kg feed were used to establish a toxic response. In the synergy study, treatments of 0 or 2.5 g kojic acid/kg feed, and 2.5 mg aflatoxin/kg feed were used in a 2 x 2 design. The toxicity of kojic acid was evident only at concentrations greater than 2 g kojic acid/kg feed and was characterized by significant (P <.05) decreases in body weights and colonic temperature, increases in relative organ weights; and various changes in both serum enzyme activities and serum metabolites. Although significant (P <.05) effects of aflatoxin and kojic acid alone were observed in the synergy study, these data did not reveal any toxic synergy existing between the 2 mycotoxins. However, kojic acid did significantly (P <.05) antagonize aflatoxin's deleterious effects upon the mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration.","Ph.

These groups are part of an Intermediary Sector of the World Economy that has evolved in scale during the last three hundred years from city to multinational and functions to facilitate infrastructure development. The idea of an Intermediary Sector is supported by documentation from previously unpublished archival material of Thomas H. MacDonald, Head of the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads from 1919 to 1953, and from the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library. International highway development in the early twentieth century is examined to answer the question, 'how does global infrastructure develop?' Documentation shows that international interaction was used to create a model of development for extensive national systems of automotive highways during the early twentieth century. The interaction was accomplished by networking among intermediary organizations to promote national economic integration and to promote national industries and financial services abroad. Further documentation reveals the origins of participating intermediary groups. The groups include chambers of commerce from 1599 to the 1920s, agencies of government that act as liaison to industry and commerce, industrial trade organizations, and groups representing individuals as taxpayers and motorists. Based on this documentation the advancement in scale of planning from city to multinational is defined by the dates of origin for local, national, international, and multinational chambers of commerce. The dissertation is structured around three questions: (1) was there global participation in international highway development; (2) was there a period of syndication of ideas to determine the model of development; (3) what was the underlying process supporting the conceptualization of the model. International interaction began in 1908 with the First International Road Congress.

Measurement of change in temperature makes use of the frequency chirping of a repetitively pulsed laser to maintain high sensitivity and enable the direction of temperature change to be determined unambiguously. The algorithm can also be directly applied to monitoring of other measurands using appropriate adapters and calibration procedures.  Using the same system configuration, a simple modification of the processing algorithm makes it possible to develop an absolute parameter monitoring system. An approximate starting value can be used instead of an exact one, giving the system more degrees of freedom. Automatic detection of the starting value of the parameter used as a reference point at the beginning of the measurement opens the door to a practical sensor system.  Adding one more sensor to the same system setup provides a simultaneous measurement of temperature and strain. This is done by configuring one sensor to experience only temperature change and the other to experience both temperature and strain changes. The measured strain will be calculated by finding the difference between the two measured values of round-trip phase shift in the interferometers. Depending on the need, appropriate modification of the algorithm can be used for simultaneous measurement of temperature and other parameters of interest.","Ph.

However, no in-depth inquiry has been conducted in the nation to identify the factors influencing students to leave school before attaining a desirable program of study. This study was, therefore, conducted to identify the primary reasons related to students dropping out of school in Ethiopia. The research is a descriptive survey study. The study examined the perceptions held by Ethiopian educators (teachers, principals, and central office administrators) regarding early school-leavers in the country. Data pertinent to the study was obtained from a sample of 315 national educators attending the 1989 Summer Inservice Programs at Addis Ababa University in Addis Ababa and Kotobe Teachers College at Kotobe. A survey instrument designed for this purpose was used as a means of data gathering. The findings of the study show the following reasons as the top ten factors influencing students to drop out of school in Ethiopia: socio-economic status, providing assistance to parents during seasonal crop harvest, uncertainty of career goals, early marriage, attending to additional home responsibilities, lack of learning interest, influence of large family size, low level of parental education, poor academic achievement, and poor health. Also, the inability to pay school fees, distance of school from home, problems with the language of instruction, pregnancy, irrelevant curriculum, low self-esteem, full-time employment, the impact of single parenting, and addiction to substances have been found to have intermediate effects upon the continued schooling of students. In addition to these factors, the effects of natural disasters, and the policy of conscripting young men into the government military, or the practices employed by the opposing rebel groups in recruiting youth into their guerilla forces, were identified by the study population as some of the most glaring factors leading students to withdraw from school in Ethiopia.","Ph.

The effect of boron, present at a level of ~10²⁰/cm³was also determined. Transmitted angular distributions, for particles of incident energy in the range: 80-180 keV, were measured using a movable silicon surface barrier detector with a resolution of $\sim$3 keV and an acceptance angle of 0.1°. Planar orientations yielded smaller transmitted half-angles than axial orientations without a significant loss in transmitted yield. The half-angles of particles transmitted along planes, unlike axes, were found to vary with azimuthal angle. The best orientation for use in MIBL was determined to be the {110} planar orientation. Half-angles for particles transmitted along this plane, and for particles transmitted along the {100} plane, were smallest for scans perpendicular to the plane; largest, for scans parallel to it. Scans parallel to the plane were similar in width to scans across axes especially at higher energies and were shown, through calculation, to be consistent with the spreading expected for particles undergoing electronic multiple scattering at a reduced electron density. The presence of boron was found to increase the transmitted half-angle by ~10% over the entire energy range. This relatively small improvement in half-angle does not, by itself, warrant the use of undoped films over boron doped films in an MIBL application.","Ph.

Sixteen mobile homes had no significant pattern of usage; 150 mobile homes showed a significant pattern of electrical usage. Ninety-eight of those had coefficients of determination above 0.70. Comparisons of predicted and actual usage of air-conditioning, heating, and base load of each mobile home are shown.  Data of area, perimeter, value, and age from public records with heating and cooling efficiency, heating and cooling knot temperatures, and base load estimates produced by the spline regressions, such as were used in backward, forward, and step wise regressions. Using aggregate data, the best predictors of annual energy usage in mobile homes in three different usage groups were the crossproduct of a variables defined as heating or cooling efficiency multiplied by a temperature differential value which acknowledges all mobile homes are operated with unique balance, or knot, temperatures and base load. The aggregate models did not need any other variables such as perimeter, value, area or age of the homes to achieve an r-square of 0.95 in a no intercept model. The intercept models achieved a r-square values averaging 0.87. Physical characteristic variables and statistical estimates of knot temperatures and base load were determined to be components of heating and coaling efficiency and base load.  There was a very wide range of usage indicative of a wide range of occupant behavior. None of the mobile homes heating or cooling over a normalized year was 1.5 standard deviation less than the mean. Those mobile homes which used more than 1.5 standard deviation above the mean were identified as the extreme energy usage frontier users.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) test accepted, yet untested, hypotheses regarding the influence of May and spring precipitation on Attwater's spring breeding numbers; (2) survey parasitism and infectious disease prevalence; and, (3) determine which demographic and reproductive variables most limit Attwater's population growth.  The accepted hypotheses that greater than normal spring (Mar-Jun) or May precipitation leads to decreased Attwater's breeding numbers the following spring, while drought during this period leads to increased numbers, were not supported by the data. However, breeding success could account for breeding numbers the following spring. Analysis of the geographic incidence of prairie grouse helminthic endoparasitism predicted that Attwater's should maintain parasite diversity similar to greater prairie chicken (T. c. pinnatus) in Illinois, Kansas, and Missouri. Although I found no hemoparasites or specific antibody against 7 infectious diseases, evidence of Trichostrongylus tenuis was found in 5 of 6 samples collected from all but 1 Attwater's population. To delineate which life-history stages most limit Attwater's numbers, I tested the hypotheses that Attwater's clutch size, egg hatchability, nesting success, brood survivorship, chick survivorship, and juvenile to adult ratios were less than those of greater prairie chicken. The Attwater's ratio of juveniles per adult, nesting success, and number of chicks per brood prior to brood breakup were substantially less than those typically seen in greater prairie chicken. Simulations predicted Attwater's nesting success, brood survival, and chick survivorship must increase sufficiently to close approximately 85% of the difference between Attwater's and greater prairie chicken values before Attwater's numbers would increase.  Results suggested that cold, humid conditions and the indirect effects of precipitation on Attwater's brood-rearing should be explored. Also, there is a need to determine if T. tenuis leads to decreased productivity in prairie chicken, as it does in other grouse species. Adult sex ratios should be accurately determined for all populations annually, and there is a need to determine why Attwater's nesting and brood-rearing success are comparatively low. Management strategies designed to reverse these conditions should be developed.","Ph.

The design technique is based on mapping the time domain constraints into the frequency domain to obtain point-wise constraints on the magnitude and phase of the nominal loop transfer function at each frequency. Once these boundaries are obtained, classical loop shaping realizes an acceptable nominal loop transfer function. To extend the design methodology to NMP and/or unstable systems, the effects of right-half-plane zeros and poles of the system on its feedback properties are studied first. Then, the design methodology is modified to accommodate such systems. For NMP systems, an inner-outer factorization is used to transform the frequency domain design boundaries on the nominal NMP loop transfer function into equivalent bounds on the corresponding MP transfer function. For unstable systems similar difficulties are also noted which in most cases can be dealt with as for the NMP case. Alternatively, prestabilization can be used, which in fact becomes necessary when the system has imaginary-axis poles. Consequently, issues regarding the type of stabilization technique that should be used, the desirable locations for placing the closed loop poles, and the effect of prestabilization on the maximum tolerable size of the step disturbance are addressed. Furthermore, a necessary condition for the existence of a solution is given which is based on transforming the design boundaries on the loop transfer function into equivalent bounds on the sensitivity function. As an application, the problem of controlling the position of a ball rolling on a beam is treated. Finally, a loop shaping algorithm is included. The algorithm is based on converting the loop shaping problem into a parameter identification scheme giving a discrete-time domain transfer function representation of the loop. The resulting pulse transfer function is then transformed back into the continuous-time domain giving an approximate transfer function for the nominal loop.","Ph.

Moench) was examined. Cultivars differing widely in kernel characteristics were: (1) soaked overnight and boiled for 10 min (Soak-Boil or SB) and (2) brought to boiling point, soaked overnight and brought to boil again (Boil-Soak-Boil or BSB). Parboiled grain was dried prior to decortication by abrasive dehulling. Both parboiling procedures significantly increased the yield of decorticated grain while reducing kernel breakage. The BSB process gave significantly higher yields with less brokens that the SB process. Decortication yield of soft endosperm cultivars (P721) was increased by two to three times with parboiling, suggesting that soft, floury cultivars such as high-lysine varieties and soft, brown sorghums (bird resistant types) was converted by parboiling into grain with excellent processing properties. Parboiled, decorticated sorghum produced a light-colored, cooked product with firm, intact kernels, acceptable appearance and aroma. Sensory properties of the cooked, parboiled grain were rated as very acceptable. The parboiled grain required more moisture and longer cooking times to yield a cooked product with tenderness comparable to that of the non-parboiled cooked product. Protein, starch, fiber and ash levels were not significantly changed by parboiling. Crude fat content was reduced by parboiling. The amber colored parboiled kernels were harder, more dense and smaller than the unparboiled grain and had a translucent appearance. Annealing of the starch during the soaking step was indicated by x-ray analysis. The formation of an amylose-lipid complex during parboiling was observed. Brightfield and scanning electron microscopy techniques showed that structure of the starch granules were altered more extensively in the peripheral layers than in the center of the kernel. Protein bodies were swollen by the treatment and the protein matrix seemed to be ""fused"" or solidified after being transformed to a mobile state by the heating treatment. Parboiling in Mali with local sorghum and millet samples confirmed the improved decortication yields obtained in the laboratory. The process requires low-level technology that is available in villages in sorghum and millet producing areas. No specialized equipment is needed to parboil grain on a village scale. Parboiling may be a practical method by which shelf-stable, processed products from sorghum and millet can be prepared while enhancing decortication yields, especially for soft cultivars.","Ph.

Plants are an important component of a CELSS because they will provide food for the crew, convert CO2 to O2, and consume waste products. In one CELSS scenario, plants will be grown in a synthetic soil capable of sustaining a controlled release of plant nutrients. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of including clinoptilolite and phosphate rock in the synthetic soil in order to provide the nutrients N, P, K, and Ca. Nitrogen and K were provided through ion exchange from a K- and NH4-saturated clinoptilolite. Phosphorus and Ca were provided by the dissolution of phosphate rock. The research consisted of chemical equilibrium and kinetic experiments using clinoptilolite:phosphate-rock mixtures, and plant-growth experiments using clinoptilolite and phosphate rock as the substrate. Equilibrium experiments indicated that sufficient levels of P, N, and K were present in solution for plant growth. Solution concentrations of nutrients were adjusted by changing the source of phosphate rock, varying the ratio of clinoptilolite to phosphate rock, and varying the Tatio of exchangeable K to exchangeable NH4 within the clinoptilolite. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that changes in solution concentrations of P, N, and K with time were best described by a power-function model, suggesting that dissolution and exchange reactions in the mixtures were probably diffusion controlled. Clinoptilolite increased the rate of phosphate-rock dissolution by adsorbing Ca, thus increasing the Ca concentration gradient, and causing faster diffusion of Ca away from the phosphate-rock surface. The data indicated that clinoptilolite:phosphate-rock mixtures can serve as slow-release sources of P, N, and K Plant-growth experiments with wheat demonstrated that clinoptilolite:phosphate-rock mixtures provided P, N, and K for several harvest periods and would be beneficial components of a synthetic soil.

Accurate estimates of three-phase relative permeability and capillary pressure functions (flow functions) are necessary to predict reservoir behavior with numerical simulators. Although several methods exist to obtain estimates of three-phase relative permeability functions, they have several assumptions that make their use limited and their results subject to controversy. In this work, a parameter estimation method for simultaneously estimating accurate three-phase relative permeability and capillary pressure functions is presented. This method has few of the assumptions made by other methods. Also, the mathematical model used by the method has more flexibility to represent displacement experiments than the models used by other methods. In the model, core sample heterogeneities can be considered in estimating the flow functions. The method is an extension of a regression based method developed for estimating accurate two-phase flow functions using data from unsteady-state displacement experiments. In situ saturation data, obtained with CT scanning techniques, are also used in the history matching method. This type of data is a great source of information to predict correctly multiphase flow through porous media and to obtain accurate estimates of multiphase flow. To accomplish this work, a simulator of three-phase flow through anisotropic porous media was developed. The simulator can model systems in one, two or three dimensions. The flow functions were represented as functions of two saturations with B-splines due to their great flexibility to represent any smooth function. Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyze the accuracy of the estimated flow functions. To demonstrate the use of the parameter estimation method, results for estimated two-phase flow functions using simulated and experimental data are presented and discussed. In the experimental results, heterogeneities of the sample are considered in estimating the flow functions. Results for estimated three-phase flow functions for a simple simulated displacement experiment are presented to illustrate how the method can be used in this case. Since the estimation procedure requires a great amount of computer work, the Cray supercomputer was used to perform the estimation procedure fast and efficiently. The results obtained show that the parameter estimation method is reliable for obtaining accurate estimates of three-phase flow functions.","Ph.

While many studies have attempted to integrate urban activities using structural models, the time series approach has received little attention. Traditional forecasting approaches, with their highly restricted structural frameworks, reveal an inefficiency in integrating forecasts for urban activities. The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated forecasting model which efficiently captures the dynamic effects and trends of urban development. Recent development of the Vector Autoregressive Representation (VAR) model in the field of economics makes it possible to analyze multi-variate time series data using theoretical intuition. The model is appropriate for an integrated forecasting analysis because of its efficient mode and policy-endogeneity. Although there are countless urban activities, eight was the maximum number of variables to identify the dynamic urban structure because of small degrees of freedom. The chosen variables are: population, factory employment, fiscal deficit, land price index, length of paved road, permitted area of new building construction, area of farmland and forestry, and number of school classrooms. After comparing performances among three alternative VAR models, the Bayesian approach was selected as the most appropriate model for this study. After the forecasting model was obtained, comparison of unconditional forecasts with forecasts conditional upon a policy change, provided the basis to conduct policy analysis. An impulse response function technique was applied to analyze the dynamic response of each endogenous variable to a shock to the system. According to the forecasts in this study, the future of Incheon, Korea is characterized as continuing its explosive pace towards metropolis status. On the other hand, the factory employment and the agricultural land use is decreased during the forecasting period. The results indicate some trade-off relationships between activities. The results also reveal the significant gap between the ideal planned values and the forecasts.","Ph.

The first essay, entitled ""Targeting Nominal Income: Further Results,"" analyzes the implications of monetary policy rules for the performance of the economy in the context of a simple stochastic macroeconomic model under rational expectations. The goal of this essay is to determine if nominal income targeting continues to provide the optimal response to both demand and supply disturbances in a model employing the Lucas supply curve. Unlike previous results, in a more general model, nominal GNP targeting does not respond optimally to both demand and supply shocks while a fixed money supply rule may be perfectly stabilizing when wages are indexed to unanticipated changes in the price. The second essay, titled ""Monetary Policy Games and the Role of Wage Indexation,"" analyzes the role of wage indexation for the Fed's monetary policy in the context of a policy game. The objective of this essay is to examine the role of wage indexation as a resolution of the credibility problem. Full indexation eliminates not only the Fed's incentive to cheat but also the wage setters' losses when the Fed cheats. In the presence of both demand and supply shocks, indexation is not as powerful as it is in the absence of supply shocks. It does not offset the incentive to cheat, but improves the noncooperative solution. The third essay entitled ""Is Increased Wage Flexibility Stabilizing?"" is an analysis of the relationship between wage flexibility and output fluctuation in a continuous time model with demand and supply shocks. The major issues in this essay are: If there is a mixed distribution of shocks, how does each shock affect output fluctuation? What is the implication of contract length on the relationship between aggregate shocks and output variability? How are the results changed if workers can choose the optimal indexation parameter? This study tries to answer the questions raised above in a framework in which wage flexibility and output variability are endogenously determined.","Ph.

The diurnal and seasonal variations of tropical oceanic rainfall are investigated by using the GPI for the period 19 December 1987 to 31 December 1988 over the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The coefficient of variation is found as a simple function of the mean. Seasonal variations of the coefficient of variation are small except during Northern Hemispheric summer. The time scales of area-averaged rainfall over the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) are longer than those over the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during Northern Hemispheric winter; however, they have almost the same values as those over the ITCZ region during Northern Hemispheric summer. The coefficient of variation over the Pacific ITCZ region is reasonably close to that in the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) region. There are seasonal amplitude variations in the diurnal and semidiurnal cycles. During Northern Hemispheric winter, diurnal and semidiurnal cycle amplitudes are large over the SPCZ region. Power spectrum analysis shows that the SPCZ region has suppressed rainfall at night. Rainfall is enhanced from morning to midafternoon and reaches a maximum between 1400 to 1700 local standard time (LST). During Northern Hemispheric summer, strong diurnal and semidiurnal variations were observed over the ITCZ region. Amplitudes are also large to the north of the ITCZ. The composited diurnal and semidiurnal cycles show a rainfall minimum around midnight and a rainfall maximum at 1500 LST. There is also minor enhancement around 0700 LST. These results are consistent with results over the GATE region.","Ph.

To obtain this information, mice were chosen as the experimental model. Alkaloids contained in this plant are thought to be the toxic principle. Therefore, quantitation of the total glycoalkaloid content was essential. Extensive chemical analysis of the plant was done. Hydrolysis, both in vitro and in vivo, was performed and the compounds isolated and identified. Acute intraperitoneal pilot studies with the isolates were done to ascertain which ones, if any, were toxic. Two ninety-day chronicity studies were performed on the mice, one with a crude extract of the plant and one with pure suspected toxin. In both studies, the mice were observed for indications of neurologic dysfunction. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory potential of S. dimidiatum was also explored to discern if this contributes to the demise of the animal. An ancillary objective was to elucidate any hepatoxicity since diosgenin, an known hepatotoxin, was isolated. The mice dosed with the crude extract (medium and high dosage groups) of Solanum dimidiatum lost a significant amount of weight, suggesting intoxication from the glycoalkaloid. Those given the aglycone, however, did not exhibit gastrointestinal injury. The high and medium dose groups in both chronicity studies had reduced acetylcholinesterase activity, but apparently not severe enough to cause death or the neurologic deficit in question. Neither study resulted in a significant difference in the mice's ability to complete the ataxia assay. The high and medium dose groups in the second chronicity study with solanidine displayed aberrant behavior. This response, which included nervousness, extreme agitation, and episodes of aggressiveness, was dose related. Histopathology of the cerebellums and spinal cords revealed no lesions. In vivo and in vitro hydrolyzed compounds were isolated and identified. Oddly enough, the two systems did not provide identical compounds although the parent compounds were the same, namely the glycoalkaloids solanine and chaconine. Both hydrolysis systems discerned the presence of sapogenins that are potentially toxic.","Ph.

Explanations based on forgetting and elaborative processing both intimate that the additional cognitive activity required during high Cl practice contributes to the emergence of this effect. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the attention demands associated with the two practice conditions by using a dual-task method. The primary task was to learn three key-pressing patterns with three segmental timing requirements for each pattern in either random or blocked practice schedule. In Experiment 1, an auditory stimulus (i.e., high or low tone) was presented unpredictably during the practice trials. Subjects were required to concentrate on the primary task during the acquisition while also monitoring the number of the high tones. The acquisition, which consisted of three blocks of 18 trials on the timing task, was followed by 10-min and 24-hour delayed retention tests. Results showed the typical Cl effect with retention performance being facilitated by the random practice, even though acquisition performance was superior for the blocked practice. Random practice subjects produced more errors on the secondary task, indicating that greater attentional demands were required during random practice. However, a cautious interpretation of these data was necessary because degraded primary task performance was observed for the dual-task condition, compared with the control condition. Experiment 2 attempted to eliminate this problem, but failed to replicate the findings on the secondary task performance. Using a discrete reaction time (RT) probe task in Experiment 3, the findings from Experiment 1 were replicated, as well as eliminating the primary task problem observed in Experiment 1. The data from Experiment 3 are consistent with the predictions from the elaboration view. In Experiment 4, a modified practice condition was employed to directly test the forgetting hypothesis. The results provide support for the contribution of a reconstructive process to random practice. These data are discussed with respect to the contribution of forgetting and elaboration explanations for the Cl effect.","Ph.

The equations are limited to the case where linear stress/strain relations are adequate for describing the deformation. The idea of the modeling is to allow for the possibility of relative fluid/solid motion and the possibility of a second (slow) compressional wave. By directly volume averaging the balance laws that hold in the solid and fluid phases while accounting for the boundary conditions on the pore walls separating the fluid and solid, Biot's (1956a,b; 1962a,b) equations are obtained. The definitions of the elastic moduli given by Biot and Willis (1957) are also obtained. However, models for the inertial operator controlling the magnitude of relative flow have been considered that were not allowed for by Biot. In modeling this inertial relative-flow operator, Biot limited himself to the case where the pores are modeled as constant-width flow channels. In this work, three generalizations to Biot's relative flow model are treated. First, pores that possess variation in their width are allowed for with the result that less relative-flow is predicted as compared to Biot's model. Second, bumps on the surface of an otherwise smooth and constant-width flow channel are allowed for with the result that if the bump heights are much smaller than the channel widths, then the relative flow inertial operator remains unaffected by the surface roughness. Third, electrokinetic or ""streaming potential"" forces are allowed for with the result that if the liquid is a low molarity brine (molarities < 10^-3 ) and if the flow channels have small enough widths (< 1 micron) then the relative flow may be reduced by up to 45% compared to Biot's model. Lastly, expressions for the phase velocities, attenuation coefficients and normal-incidence reflection/transmission coefficients are obtained using a displacement/stress-vector formulation of the equations of motion.","Ph.

To that end, I have examined eighty personal experience stories written by fourteen- to sixteen year-olds at both discourse and syntactic levels. I have also examined gender and ethnicity as influences that affect both the structure and theme of these adolescents' stories. I analyzed eighty written personal experience stories, twenty each from black and white boys and girls in junior high and high schools in a mid-sized Central Texas school district. The students were asked to write an in-class, first-draft response-to the prompt, 'tell a story about a frightening experience you have had.' Using models established by linguists, rhetoricians, and psychologists, I examined the stories to answer the following questions: (1) how do these adolescents structure their stories; (2) what clause types do they use to encode story components; and (3) how does gender and ethnicity influence the depiction of self, others, and the world in these adolescents' stories? Findings suggest the following: (1) contrary to claims made in previous research, this group of adolescents constructs fully formed narratives; (2) black and white students, girls and boys alike, encode essential narrative components in a variety of complex syntactic structures, though the girls' stories tend to include more clauses than the boys, and the black boys' stories tend to be short and unelaborated; (3) the black and white girls alike create storyworlds of caring and connection; (4) gender and ethnicity strongly influence the worlds created by these boys, where autonomy and celebration of masculine attributes characterize the world of the white boys, and connectedness and diversity characterize that of the black boys.","Ph.

The cyclodextrin silica based stationary phases designed for HPLC are commercially available and offer unique selectivity for a significant number of chiral compounds. However, their use for preparative separations is limited by low chiral selectivity values, low loadability and low efficiency. Currently, because there is insufficient data for making a quantitative comparison between the displacement mode and the elution mode, there is disagreement as to which preparative separation method provides higher production rates and higher per cent recovery of the loaded material. This dissertation describes the development of preparative chromatographic separations in both the displacement mode and the overloaded elution mode for a number of chiral compounds (many of which are of interest to the pharmaceutical community) on three commercially available CD stationary phases.

Population dynamics were described for Sesamia calamistis Hampson and the millet head girdler (MHG), Heliocheilus albipunctella de Joannis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Effects of planting dates on population densities of MSB and MHG were assessed. Life-fertility tables were described for Bracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). MSB was collected from fourteen alternate host plants and was parasitized by a complex of parasite species on millet and seven of the alternate host plants. A model describing interactions between MSB, host plants, and natural enemies is proposed. Mean numbers of surviving MSB in field cages excluding natural enemies were not significantly different from mean numbers of MSB that survived in field cages where natural enemies had access. These results suggest that natural enemies did not control MSB on millet. MSB oviposition was mostly associated with green millet stalks with leaf sheaths, leaf sheaths being the most preferred oviposition sites. Millet grain weight was negatively correlated with numbers of MSB larva holes. Numbers of diapausing MSB larvae and MSB larva holes increased from lower to upper stalk internodes. Many diapausing MSB larvae died during the dry season; however, a substantial number survived due to the stacking of millet stalks. MSB population densities were not reduced by adjusting millet planting dates, but were affected by millet growth stage. Platytelenomus sp. (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) was the most common parasite of MSB on millet. Parasitism of MSB larvae and pupae was rare. S. calamistis was a minor pest of millet in Niger, and was rarely parasitized. MHG population densities were reduced by delaying millet planting dates. Bracon hebetor was the most common parasite of MHG. Life-fertility tables for B. hebetor developing on MHG showed that on the average, mated parasite females lived 24.7 days, oviposited for 22 days, and produced 173.7 adult progeny with a ca. 1:1 sex ratio.

Analysis of the promoter using a transient transfection assay has identified several regions that are sensitive to mutation. This approach has certain limitations which can be overcome through the use of an in vitro transcription assay. In an attempt to identify and characterize proteins required for regulating transcription, an in vitro system derived from bovine liver nuclear extract was developed which is capable of transcribing MMTV. The sensitivity of the assay to the mycotoxin α-amanitian confirms that RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcription. Mutations which affect the activity of the promoter in vivo show a comparable decrease in transcription when tested in vitro. One of the mutations, which changes positions -2 to +6, results in a significant drop in activity both in vivo and in vitro. Using electrophoresis mobility shift and DNase I footprinting experiments, a protein is shown to bind to sequences between -12 and +13. This protein has been termed initiation site binding protein (ISBP). Efficient transcription from the MMTV promoter requires binding of ISBP as demonstrated by a competition assay in which an oligonucleotide containing sequences from -16 to +17 was able to inhibit promoter activity in vitro. To further define the bases needed for ISBP binding and activity, 58 plasmids with mutations between -4 and +10 were constructed. These mutant promoters were tested in a mobility shift assay and used as templates in the in vitro transcription reaction. The bases that were the most sensitive to mutation were between +5 and +10. This sequence of 5'-CAGTCC-3' defines the core region for ISBP binding and transcriptional activity. The SV40 late and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) promoters have functionally significant sequences at their start sites that are homologous to the core region defined for ISBP binding. To determine if the protein interacting with the SV40 and DHFR promoters was the same as ISBP, a series of binding competition experiments was performed. The ability of the SV40 and DHFR sequences to affect in vitro transcription from the MMTV promoter was also tested. The results of these experiments suggest that ISBP is a distinct protein from the one(s) that interacts with the SV40 and DHFR promoters.","Ph.

When a diatomic molecule suffers the loss of electrons, it will generally dissociate into ions having considerable amounts of kinetic energy as a result of their mutual Coulomb repulsion. In the present work, experiments designed to examine the yield and kinetic energy distributions associated with different charge division pathways for the dissociation of multicharged CO, N2 and O2 molecular ions were performed. A beam of 96 MeV Ar[^14+] ions was directed through a differentially pumped gas cell containing the molecules of interest into a microchannel plate detector. Dissociation products produced in ionizing collisions were accelerated out of the gas cell by an electric field into a time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometer. Upon reaching the end of the flight tube, the ions were detected by another set of microchannel plates. An acceptable binary dissociation event was one for which both dissociation-product ions were detected. The TOF of the first ion to reach the detector and the time difference between the arrival of the first ion and its partner were recorded on magnetic tape event-by-event so as to maintain their correlation. Separation of the time-difference (Δt) distributions into sets correlated with the charge of the first ion was accomplished by off-line sorting of the event-by-event data. Transformation of the Δt distributions into total kinetic energy distributions (TKED) required a detailed simulation of the ion trajectories in order to construct the response matrix of the spectrometer system. The average total kinetic energies were determined for all the observed dissociation channels and used to calculate the average excitation energies of the parent molecular ions. The TKED of CO[^2+] was in very good agreement with previous measurements obtained in a photoionization study using synchroton radiation. The present measurements indicate that states of higher excitation are populated in ion-molecule collisions. Moreover, the average total kinetic energies were systematically higher than the point-charge Coulomb energies for fully screened ions separated by the equilibrium bond length.","Ph.

A nuisance of many existing nonparametric tests is that they depend on a smoothing parameter whose choice can be arbitrary. Two nonparametric tests are proposed that overcome this problem by using data-driven smoothing parameters derived from risk estimation procedures. In the first test the regression function is estimated using a Rogosinski-type Fourier series estimator, and the test statistic is a data-driven smoothing parameter that minimizes an unbiased estimator of the risk in estimating the regression. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is derived and the consistency of the test under fixed and local alternatives is obtained. The second test is one for checking the adequacy of a parametric regression model. The test statistic is the L2 norm of a Fourier series that is fitted to the residuals from the parametric model. The smoothing parameter is obtained by minimizing a risk criterion. When the null model is linear the distribution of the test statistic does not depend on the regression coefficients; while if the null model is nonlinear the distribution of the test statistic m ay depend on the regression parameters. A bootstrap procedure is recommended for this case. The consistency of the test under fixed alternatives is obtained. A simulation study compares the power of the two proposed tests with some existing tests. The power of the L2--based test is studied when different variance estimators are used in the risk criterion and in the test statistic. The two tests are applied to a data set.","Ph.

Today, our ability to collect and present data outstrips our ability to interpret it. This situation has been called ""information input overload"" (Miller 1960). Information input overload was first investigated by Miller as the logical opposite of information input deprivation and is now accepted as an everyday occurrence. Information input overload is known to have a deleterious effect on decision makers (Sheridan and Ferrell 1974). These effects include: ignoring further input, delay in making a decision, filtering the data, and giving up (Miller 1960). A knowledge-based system was developed that is not affected by information input overload. The system makes full use of data, knowledge, and other information, extracts the critical decision factors and follows a decision tree to find related pieces of information. The system puts these factors into a form that minimizes the volume of data while presenting a complete picture of the situation to the decision maker. The system was tested against project management and performed equally well in identifying core problem areas. The system performed significantly better than did project management in assigning treatments to these core areas, thus minimizing risk, optimizing use of resources, and enforcing the prescribed protocol. The knowledge-based system also satisfactorily identified areas indirectly affected and performed significantly better than project management in assigning treatments to those areas. In addition, the system provided superior documentation of reasoning and actions to be taken. It also provided a platform for using existing simulation models to aid in strategic decision making, and for a geographic information system to aid tactical performance of recommendations. The system used object-oriented design, expert system techniques, a link to simulation models, and database management in an integrated system to optimize, improve, and ease the decision making process, whether under the effects of information input overload or not.","Ph.

The effects of cognitive style differences and different computer-based presentations on concept learning were studied. There were two main objectives. First, to investigate the relationship of two dimensions of cognitive style, Field Independence-Field Dependence (FI-FD) and preferred perceptual mode (Verbal-Visual). Second, to study the main and interactive effects of the two cognitive style dimensions on the performance of individuals on a concept learning task in the context of two presentation formats within a CBI lesson: Text-Only and Text-plus-Animated-Graphics. A secondary objective of this study was to investigate the time spent by individuals on the two lesson formats. A total of 192 undergraduate volunteer subjects participated in an introductory computer-delivered presentation of velocity and acceleration concepts. Independent variables consisted of the two dimensions of cognitive style and the presentation format. The Group Embedded Figures Test and the Verbalizer-Visualizer Questionnaire were used to identify the cognitive style of the individuals. The dependent variable used in the study was a 21-item, multiple choice posttest. The data analysis was conducted in two stages. First, the relationship of the two cognitive style dimensions was established using a correlational study. Further, a multiple regression analysis with the posttest as the criterion and the three independent variables and two-way interactions between them as predictors was conducted. Results of the main objectives indicated that the FI-FD and Verbal-Visual cognitive style dimensions are independent. Also, individuals presented with a lesson format that matched their Verbal/Visual preference did not seem to improve their performance. Finally, there was no main effect of the FI-FD cognitive style on the performance measure indicating that the more FI individuals did not differ significantly in achievement from their less FI peers. A regression analysis conducted with the time spent in lesson as the criterion showed that individuals receiving the Text-plus-Animated-Graphics presentation spent significantly less time in the lesson compared to the Text-Only group.","Ph.

Specifically, the primary research questions to be addressed are: 1. What types of divestitures of business units by a diversified multibusiness firm are perceived favorably by the capital market (i.e., as strategic actions conducive to superior future performance)? 2. What types of acquisitions of business units (divested by another firm) are perceived favorably by the capital market (i.e., as strategic actions conducive to superior future performance)? 3. What effect does the type of relatedness of the divested business unit to the firm's core business (and/or other businesses in the firm's portfolio) have on the change in the market value of the firm? 4. What effect does the type of relatedness of the acquired business unit to the firm's core business (and/or other businesses in the portfolio) have on the change in the market value of the firm? 5. How does relative size of the divested/acquired unit influence the market value of the transaction? An event study methodology is used to examine the relationship between strategy choice (acquisitions and divestitures) and performance. Strategy choice is assessed by classifying the acquisitions and divestitures of business units into related and unrelated categories. The findings support the hypotheses that firms can increase their market value by expanding into product-markets that are related to that firm's core competencies and/or from exiting from product-markets unrelated to those core competencies. The change in market value associated with an unrelated divestiture-related acquisition dyad was found to be greater than the change in market value associated with other dyads examined, with the exception of the unrelated divestiture-unrelated acquisition dyad.","Ph.

Field data from three sites, one near Brady and two near Sonora, Texas, were used to validate model output for forage standing crop and quality, diet composition and quality, and sheep intake and production. Simulation experiments were conducted to test the sensitivity of the models to changes in the initial partitioning of leaf and stem and live and dead in forage standing crop and in the palatability, harvestability, and avoidance values of forage pools. Simulated trends for forage dynamics, diet selection, and sheep production generally followed observed patterns for each of the three sites. Forage dynamics were driven by growth and showed greater sensitivity to the division of leaf and stem within the initial standing crop than to the division of live and dead. Diet selection was highly responsive to changes in forage availability. Trends in diet selection closely followed the seasonal growth patterns of warm- and cool-season grasses and forbs. Palatability, harvestability, and avoidance parameters were most sensitive when live biomass was limiting. Avoidance affected the preference of a forage pool, while palatability and harvestability affected intake. Responses to the diet search algorithm suggested a need for more precise measures of the relation between forage availability and intake, and a better understanding of forage dynamics, particularly for forbs. The linked models provide a working hypothesis for evaluating the dynamic interaction between available forage and diet selection.","Ph.

The flagellar apparatus consists of a functional kinetosome, nonfunctional centriole, anchoring struts, basal mitochondrion, and a root system consisting of a rhizoplast and a microtubular root. This study was undertaken to more clearly understand the relationship between flagellar apparatus structure and function, with emphasis placed on the flagellar root system. The specific aims of this study were: 1) Reconstruct from transmission electron micrographs the structure of the flagellar apparatus. 2) Determine the possible function(s) of the rhizoplast 3) Determine the developmental sequence of the rhizoplast during sporogenesis. 4) Determine whether α-tubulin of the microtubular root is acetylated. The structural observations make it likely that the rhizoplast may allow the flagellum to determine the direction of motility since the rhizoplast is attached directly to the a- and c- tubules of the kinetosome triplets 1, 2, and 9. The rhizoplast also functions to link the single basal mitochondrion to the kinetosome. This establishes an inherent polarity in the cell so that the plane of flagellar beat is always oriented in the same direction with respect to the internal organization of the cell. The rhizoplast may also function to align the flagellar apparatus of the male and female gametes following fusion. The microtubular root is resistant to microtubule depolymerizing drugs. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates the presence of α-1 and α-3 tubulin isoforms in axonemal and flagellar root microtubules, suggesting that both sets of microtubules may exist primarily in an acetylated (α-3) state. This was confirmed by cross reaction of tubulin from axonemes and the microtubular root with antibodies (gift from G. Piperno) directed against acetylated a-tubulin. This acetylation may contribute to the stability of the microtubular root. Development of the rhizoplast occurs after the onset of sporogenesis. The rhizoplast is fully formed immediately prior to cleavage of the sporangium. Evidence is presented that a specific region of the nuclear membrane (nucleus-associated organelle) is instrumental in aligning the kinetosome to the nucleus, associated with the forming rhizoplast, and possibly functions to help orient the basal mitochondrion to the kinetosome.","Ph.

Sensory evaluation showed that coarse-ground patties were harder, denser, more easily fractured and less juicy than flaked or flaked/ground treatments. All treatments were similar in flavor attributes. Patties of coarse-ground treatment had higher cooking and reheating losses and higher shear after reheating than flaked or flaked/ground treatments. Flaked patties had higher yields and improved textural properties; however, they also showed surface ""puffing"" and an internal air pocket after microwave reheating. The flaking-grinding combination appeared to produce more desirable, low-fat, precooked beef patties with optimum yield and textural properties. Patties containing an alginate/carrageenan combination had higher yield and moisture and lower shear than those containing alginate or carrageenan alone within the same fat levels. Alginate/carrageenan patties containing 5 or 10% fat were comparable in yield, shrinkage, fat retention, shear and water-holding capacity. Alginate appeared to improve texture slightly more than carrageenan, but carrageenan tended to release more free water after cooking and reheating. Patties with 10% fat were generally lower in shear, yield and percentage released free water as compared to their 5% fat counterparts. Low-fat, precooked, ground beef parties containing alginate/carrageenan combination were superior to regular beef patties (20% fat control) regarding yields and textural properties, and should be considered when low-fat beef patties are destined for microwave reheating. The protein-hydrocolloid interactions were characterized in an emulsion containing selected hydrocolloids. Following heating, actin in the carrageenan treatment appeared to increase in molecular size or change in shape but the result was reversed in alginate/carrageenan treatment. Protein net charge did not change in the control or alginate treatment when the temperature increased from 65.6 to 71.1°C. The results suggested that alginate could provide more protective effects to myofibrillar proteins regarding unchanged protein concentrations and stable configuration during heat denaturation.","Ph.

The adsorption isotherms were BET type II isotherms, which indicate multilayer adsorption in the pores. The magnitude of the calculated heats of adsorption confirmed that the adsorption was physical adsorption. It was also shown that adsorption of relatively non-polar organics took place uniformly on the available external surface area whereas water adsorption was much greater probably due to the polar nature of water molecules that allows them access to the internal clay layers and/or capillary condensation. As moisture is always present in the natural soil environment, the effect of humidity on organics' adsorption was assessed by measuring the sorption equilibria of toluene and chlorobenzene at different relative humidity levels. The sorption isotherms at low relative humidity were BET type II isotherms whereas at high relative humidities, they exhibited a type III behavior. In all cases, the presence of humidity reduced the organic uptake on soil. At high relative humidity and low organic relative vapor concentration, there was almost complete suppression of organic adsorption. At high organic relative vapor concentration, there was competitive adsorption of water and organic. The shape of the desorption profile was very much linked to the shape of the adsorption isotherms and showed a two-step behavior. The first step corresponded to the desorption of the multilayers and the second step to the monolayer desorption. This last step was the rate-limiting step for the overall decontamination process. It was shown that using a water-saturated gas stream improved greatly the organic removal rates by accelerating the monolayer desorption. A model was proposed to simulate breakthrough curves and desorption profiles, assuming local equilibrium between the pore gas phase and the solid phase and an axially-dispersed flow pattern. The sensitive parameters of the model were the axial dispersion coefficient and the adsorption equilibrium. The local equilibrium assumption gave good results which proved that there was no slow diffusion necessitating the consideration of a kinetic/retardation term.","Ph.

Bilingual education programs have been developed for these children which allow for a dual language instructional approach. This dual language approach advocates the use of the student's dominant language to enrich the acquisition of a second language. Cummins (1983), Garcia (1976), and Thonis (1983) have indicated that an instructional focus on the development of dominant language literacy will have a positive impact on second language literacy. However, some educators advocate the premature placement of Spanish dominant children in classrooms where all academic subjects are taught in the second language (English). Robledo & Cortez (1983) and Goldenberg (1987) have documented that this practice sometimes decreases the English reading performance of bilingual Spanish-English children. This condition may occur because cognitive/academic literacy (Cummins, 1983) has not yet been developed. This study attempted to determine if the Spanish and English reading performance of third grade Spanish dominant students would increase following the development of metacognitive reading strategy training in their dominant language. This experimental study was limited to 95 Spanish dominant children enrolled in the Aldine Independent School District. The ITBS English reading test and the La Prueba Spanish reading test were used as a pre and post measures. Improvement in the mean scores of the experimental group following metacognitive intervention indicated improvement in the reading analysis strategies and reading performance of the children.

This leakoff results in absolute and relative permeability reduction around the fracture. This dissertation summarizes a study of the fracture fluid cleanup behavior and well production performance after a fracture treatment and presents, in more detail, new methods to analyze well test data for hydraulically fractured wells. The research originated from the observation that poor fracture fluid cleanup might help explain disappointing well production performance for certain hydraulically fractured gas wells. We studied both single- and multi- layer gas reservoirs and we identified factors associated with gas production and fracture fluid cleanup in low-permeability, low-pressure reservoirs. We found key factors which dominate fracture fluid cleanup and gas production behavior. We also discuss possible incorrect simplifications for multilayer, anisotropic reservoirs. The major effort in this study was to develop new solutions for finite conductivity fractures including wellbore storage and fracture-face skin damage. The infinite conductivity fracture solution is included as a limiting case. The new solutions are obtained numerically by modeling a general elliptical wellbore in an elliptically-composite reservoir, including the effects of wellbore storage and infinitesimal fracture-face skin. The new solutions agree with analytical solutions. The time span studied (dimensionless time to) was from 10^-8 to 10^5. These new solutions provide new perspectives for finite conductivity fractures with wellbore storage and fracture-face skin. Both pressure and pressure derivatives are presented in type curves. New techniques, which are based on the new solutions, were used to analyze post-fracture welltest data. We could not analyze these data accurately with published solutions.

The major bottle-neck during statistical circuit design is caused by the prohibitive cost of circuit simulation for statistical analysis. The computational burden is reduced by using suitable approximation models of the performance functions of interest. The major emphasis is placed on Design for Quality (DFQ) which aims to minimize the variance of the performances and fulfill all the specifications. This requires more accurate approximation models than would be the case for yield maximization alone. The dissertation is divided into two major sections. The first section deals with the development of the proposed modeling strategies. The major contribution of this dissertation is the development of highly accurate approximation methodologies, which are tailored to individual applications. Three general classes of modeling strategies are developed. The first class is a black-box modeling strategy obtained by combining an interpolation scheme and a self-organizing regression scheme. The second class of methods is applied to improve the accuracy of physically based analytical models (normally preferred by designers and often available, but are usually too simple for statistical analysis) by combining them with a black-box model. The black-box part of the new model is used to provide error correction to the physically based analytical models. The final class of models can statistically characterize large CMOS combinational digital circuits, which, until now, has been beyond the state of the art. The effects of geometric and technological process parameters are included in the solution. The methodology combines analytical/black-box/numerical methods to achieve a high level of statistical accuracy, with speeds of 5 to 6 orders of magnitude faster than circuit simulation (SPICE).

TCDD inhibits the E2-induced secretion of 52-kDa protein in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Initial studies focused on the development of a unique gel staining bioassay for measurement of secreted levels of 52-kDa from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. This assay was extensively used to investigate the antiestrogenic activity of diverse polychlorinated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The results of quantitative structure-activity studies further supported a role for the AhR in mediating inhibition of E2-induced 52-kDa secretion in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that TCDD inhibited E2- induced formation of cytosolic cathepsin-D, cath-D gene transcription and cath-D promoter activity. Subsequent studies demonstrated that E2 regulates cath-D gene transcription through an ER/Spl complex and inhibition of E2-induced gene transcription by TCDD is due to disruption of the ER/Spl complex through a xenobiotic response element which is strategically located between the ER and Spl DNA binding sites. These data suggest a unique mechanism of action for the AhR which acts as a ligand-induced transcription attenuator.

Findings from this study indicate that fixed-guideway, rapid-transit systems have a strong positive impact on land values. Factors other than transit facilities, however, contribute to the increase of property values near the stations. A statistical model using regression techniques was devised to show the pattern of land-value changes near fixed-guideway, rapid-transit stations. Price flexibility of distance ε[fd] concept was also used to measure the percentage change in the price of land with respect to change in land distance from a development area.","Ph.

With a central processor, hardware replication is mandatory to continue processing in the face of hardware failures. Otherwise, processing must generally halt for a period of hardware repair. A local area network already contains replicated hardware, along with software to support communications over links connecting the individual nodes. The existence of duplicated hardware, and independent processing ability within each node, allows for a concentration on software support for fault tolerance. Hardware replication can be limited to such areas as network topologies which employ multiple links among the nodes. This research concentrates on software approaches to fault tolerance in a (loosely coupled) network environment. Current approaches are studied. These turn out to emphasize special purpose languages and operating systems designed to allow for transparent distribution of tasks amongst the nodes. The failure scenarios under which faults will be masked varies widely. Specifically, this research develops a set of language and operating system protocols to implement a level of fault tolerance. This Fault Tolerant Monitor (FTM) system is layered above the operating system. Cooperating applications which desire to avail themselves of the fault tolerance services offered by the FTM system advertise themselves to it. Other applications may simultaneously be executing on the network as if the FTM system were not present. The FTM system consists of an FTM module running on each node. These communicate together. Applications are provided with an Intercept Library which is linked into each executable. This defined procedure interface isolates the applications from the FTM system protocols. Services such as node-independent message delivery and restart/relocation of failing applications are offered. An FTM system following the protocols is developed and implemented under UNIX. It is utilized to generate performance statistics, and performance is compared between applications which utilize the FTM services, and those which bypass them.","Ph.

The FII is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure family interaction on 24 different family constructs. The FII was designed to measure the trans-theoretical aspects of an individual's perceptions of his or her family. The current literature in this area indicates that there are several measures which have taken an eclectic approach to measuring family functioning, but may lack the comprehensiveness, clinical utility, or adequate psychometrics to provide an accurate measure of total family functioning. The development of the this instrument included a review of currently available assessment devices of family functioning and eleven major theoretical orientations of family therapy. Twenty-four separate theoretically relevant family functioning constructs were identified and 253 items measuring those constructs were written. Through various card sort procedures, the item pool was reduced to 120 items measuring 24 separate constructs (five items per construct). A 10-item version of the short form of the Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability Scale was embedded to assess the effects of social desirability on the FII. The FII was administered to 664 undergraduates attending Texas A&M University. A series of Principal Components analysis was used to determine the factor structure underlying the Family Interaction Inventory. The results of the factor analysis indicated that the eleven factor solution emerged as the most readily interpretable and offered eleven potentially meaningful dimensions of family interaction.

A human IGHG4 probe was used to map the immunoglobulin heavy chain gamma constant region to bovine chromosome 21 (syntenic group U4). FOS, FES, PDGFB, IL1, SCN2A, and MYCN were also mapped to bovine syntenic groups, and uncovered many interesting areas of evolutionary differences between bovine, human and murine syntenic groups.

The probes used for mapping were used to screen cattle of several different breeds for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). It is hoped that the polymorphisms generated by this study will be linked to traits of economic importance, and, as such, can be used in breeding programs. The IGHG4 probe was used to screen a bovine sperm DNA library for homologous sequences. Three clones were isolated, two of which appeared to be identical based on restriction analysis. Restriction maps are reported for the clones. Further analysis of the clones through sequencing, in addition to mapping more markers to the bovine syntenic groups containing the immunoglobulin genes, will add to our knowledge of mammalian genome evolution, and the evolution of the immunoglobulin genes in particular.","Ph.

This study investigated the usefulness of twenty-two D-segments as heterologous probes in bovine somatic cell mapping as well as genetic mapping. Six D-segments, D5S6, D5S20, D5S39, D10S20, D11S16, and D12S2 hybridized to unique bovine DNA sequences. D5S6, D5S20, and D5S39 were 100% concordant with one another. D10S20 mapped to U26 (BTA26), D11S16 mapped to U19 (BTA15), and D12S2 was assigned to U3 (BTA5). Four of the six D-segments that hybridized to unique bovine DNA sequences showed RFLPs in cattle. Polymorphism information content (PIC) values calculated for RFLPs found in bovine were generally smaller than those published for human. D5S39 showed the highest PIC value (0.25 with Msp I) and was chosen to be used as a genetic marker in a genetic linkage study in cattle. Three HSA5 gene probes, HEXB, HTR1A, and MAP1B were investigated for their potential to be used as genetic markers with D5S39 in a genetic linkage study in cattle. Somatic cell hybrid analyses found these loci to be 100% concordant with D5S39. The three gene probes showed PIC values between 0.16 and 0.37 in bovine and were therefore deemed suitable as genetic markers in cattle. Linkage analysis of D5S39, HEXB, HTR1A, and MAP1B showed all four genes to be closely linked in bovine. The most likely gene order based on the sum of adjacent lods (SAL) ranking method was calculated to be HEXB-D5S39-MAP1B-HTR1A. Linkage between D5S39 and HEXB as well as D5S39 and MAP1B was found to be conserved between human and bovine. Linkage data entered into the International Bovine Linkage Data Base at the University of Queensland, Australia showed D5S39, HEXB, HTR1A, and MAP1B to be linked to microsatellites on BTA15. The usefulness of human anonymous DNA-segments in bovine gene mapping appears to be limited. Only 27% of the D-segments selected hybridized to unique bovine DNA sequences. Mapped D-segments showed less RFLPs with lower PIC values in bovine compared to those reported in human and, therefore, appear to be less useful as markers for genetic linkage analysis in bovine.","Ph.

Collision of the twin DEZ ridges with the Vanuatu Island arc complicates subduction in the Central New Hebrides Trench. The North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge (NDR) and Bougainville Guyot appear to clog the trench, uplifting Espiritu Santo Island at a rapid rate and helping to form the NAB, a deep depression of the Pacific plate which traps sediment and ash from the surrounding island volcanoes. Water content and porosity measurements indicate significantly less fluid exists in the Vanuatu accretionary complex than was found by previous drilling in the Barbados and Nankai prisms. This is due in part to sediments being incorporated into the complex from the DEZ which are more coarse-grained, less porous, and more permeable than the pelagic clay-dominated Barbados forearc. Tectonically induced lateral compression is taking place in the collision complex, resulting in pore volume reduction, sediment strengthening, and intense dewatering through fracture permeability. Lower matrix permeabilities in certain sedimentary units appear to channel fluids through thrust faults to more permeable, tectonically fractured lithologies. Sediments in the DEZ are primarily overconsolidated, due to intensive dewatering during the collision process. Geotechnical tests also provide evidence that each ridge of the d'Entrecasteaux zone causes a different style of forearc deformation. The denser NDR is subducting beneath Espiritu Santo and its sediment cover is being sheared off and accreted, while the more buoyant Bougainville Guyot is riding up on the arc and overconsolidating sediments in its path. Underconsolidated sediments and probable excess pore pressures on the flank of the North d'Entrecasteaux Ridge are evidence of a ""squeegee effect"" in front of the ridge as its scrapes material northward while obliquely subducting beneath the Vanuatu Islands. Progressively underconsolidated sediments with depth below the seafloor in the North Aoba Basin attest to rapid deposition as the result of active Quaternary volcanism. Relatively low intergranular permeabilities range from 10^-6 to 10^-8 cm/sec, and vary within lithostratigraphic horizons. Permeability values appear lower in the d'Entrecasteaux Zone than in the North Aoba Basin, possibly due to collision.","Ph.

When the deterioration is governed by a Markov process, such a process is known as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, which is a generalization of a completely observable Markov Decision Process. This research investigates a three-state partially observable Markov Decision Process in which only deterioration can occur and for which the only actions possible are to replace or not to replace the machine. The goal of this research is to first prove that a control-limit policy is optimal, and then incorporate such a policy into the policy iteration algorithm given by Sondik, in order to enhance its computational efficiency.  Two conditions are presented which guarantee that the optimal replacement policy can be limited to control-limit policies for the partially observable case. One condition is a slight modification of Derman's first condition, and the other one is the same as Derman's second condition. A solution algorithm which adopts the basic idea of Sondik's policy iteration algorithm is proposed. Finally, computational comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","Ph.

The sand and silt contain both di- and trioctahedral mica. Mica particles in the Peshawar profile are smaller and less abundant than in the Gujranwala and Lyallpur soils. The coarse clays are composed of mica, kaolinite, chlorite, and quartz. The fine clays are composed of smectite and mica with small amounts of hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite and kaolinite. The surface horizons contain greater mica contents compared to the subsurface horizons which is attributed to sedimentation of mica through irrigation in the Ap horizon. The Lyallpur and Peshawar soils have lower charge density clays than the Gujranwala soil. The Fe(II) + Mg contents were the highest in the Lyallpur clay and the lowest in the Gujranwala clay. The higher Fe(II) + Mg contents suggest trioctahedral nature of smectite and a high amount of unweathered biotite.

Out of the 90 alkaloids which have been isolated and characterized, vinblastine and vincristine (bis-indoles) are of great clinical importance due to their anti-tumor activity. A better understanding ofthe various enzyme catalyzed steps in the biosynthetic pathways is important because of the extremely low yields in chemical syntheses and very low availability of these alkaloids from the plant.  This dissertation has focussed on the first two steps of the indole alkaloid pathway--(a) the stereospecific condensation of tryptamine and secologanin which leads to the formation of 3($\alpha$)-S strictosidine, which is catalyzed by strictosidine synthase, and (b) the hydrolysis of strictosidine by a $\beta$-glucosidase to form cathenamine.  An oligonucleotide probe derived from the sequence of the Rauvolfia serpentina strictosidine synthase gene was used to probe a Catharanthus roseus cDNA library in $\lambda$gt11. The nucleotide sequence of the C. roseus strictosidine synthase gene was determined and analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences revealed an 80% identity between the two species.  The strictosidine synthase gene was cloned into an E. coli inducible vector, pHN1+ and induction of the gene resulted in overexpression of the enzyme which accumulated mainly as insoluble inclusion bodies. Denaturation and refolding of the insoluble protein resulted in the ability to purify up to 28 mg of active enzyme from a single liter of cell culture (specific activity = 30 nkat/mg).  It was demonstrated that hydrolysis of strictosidine in C. roseus takes place by a strictosidine-specific glucosidase and a second enzyme known as cathenamine synthase is required for the stereospecific formation of cathenamine. Absence of the second enzyme leads to a mixture of cathenamine and 19-epicathenamine formed by chemical cyclization.  Various 1D and 2D NMR techniques were used for the complete $\sp1$H and $\sp{13}$C assignments and structure elucidation of new addition products of cathenamine.

This was accomplished by the use of resealed carrier erythrocytes (CRBC) containing a recombinant enzyme derived from Flavobacterium and expressed in Escherichia coli. The mechanism of the CRBC apparently was to degrade the OPs absorbed into the blood before it can exert its systemic toxic effect.  Since there were no methods reported to determine organophosphorus acid (OPA) anhydrase activity in blood, it was necessary to develop a method as hemoglobin interfered with all spectrophotometric determinations. This was accomplished by extracting the reaction products, 4-nitrophenol with dichloromethane and determining 4-nitrophenol after extraction colorimetrically. Subsequently a more convenient continuous method without solvent extraction was developed which permitted conducting kinetic studies on this enzyme.  Enzyme from cultured E. coli cells was isolated and purified over 1600 folds. The purified OPA anhydrase was successfully encapsulated within carrier erythrocytes by hypotonic dialysis. Enzymatic characteristics of the encapsulated OPA anhydrase were investigated. As diffusing through the cell membrane, paraoxon was readily degraded by the entrapped enzyme within CRBC. This enzyme apparently followed Michaelis-Menton kinetics.  When these CRBCs were incubated with paraoxon, diethylphosphate and 4-nitrophenol formed rapidly indicating these cells could rapidly degrade paraoxon. These resealed erythrocytes then were administered to mice and they were found to be extremely effective in antagonizing the lethal effect of paraoxon. These CRBCs were much more effective than the classic antidotal combination of atropine and pralidoxime (2-PAM). Moreover, these cells actually destroy the OP, whereas atropine and 2-PAM do not. The CRBCs provided a striking massive synergistic protective effect to the lethal effect of paraoxon. Animals receiving the combinational treatment of CRBC, atropine and 2-PAM can be protected against well over 1,000 LD50 doses of paraoxon. This combination of CRBC, atropine and pralidoxime is far more efficacious than any OP antidotal system ever reported.","Ph.

The tightening of product tolerances and the application of computer technology to almost every aspect of manufacturing are some of the changes that affect the role that inspection has on quality output. Due to the tightening of tolerances, manufacturing processes are not capable of rendering an adequate quality level. As a result, screening inspection as a means of guaranteeing quality levels is commonplace in today's manufacturing environment. An example of new computer technologies is Automated Visual Inspection (AVI). AVI has taken the place of an inspector in deciding whether or not a part is manufactured according to specifications. These new technologies make possible a new inspection concept known as Flexible Inspection System (FIS). Such a system uses the historical information provided by the inspection operations of a single unit in order to select an inspection routine to be used at the current inspection station and to decide whether to scrap the unit under inspection in order to optimize a global objective. The development of an FIS model applied to a serial multi-stage production system and single inspection station is the objective of this dissertation. In the modelled system, the inspection may yield type I and II errors. These characteristics together with some independence assumptions, allow the quality of the unit under manufacture to be modelled as a partially observable Markov process. Thus, the inspection allocation becomes a special case of optimal control of a partially observable Markov process under time constraints where the quality of the unit under observation is a discrete time continuous state Markov process. Time constraints are introduced to account for the limited time available for inspection allocation.","Ph.

Frequency data analyses indicated that across all age-groups, right-footed and right-handed preferences were predominant. Of interest, however, was that incidences of right-footedness were always lower than that of right-handedness, and incidences of mixed-footedness were greater than that of mixed-handedness. Gender differences in foot and hand preference behaviors were not evident (p < .05). Significant (p < .001) age-related differences were found in foot, but not hand, preference behaviors. Post hoc analyses revealed that 4- and 8-year olds were less right-footed than that of the older age groups. It was concluded that when compared to handedness, foot preference behaviors are more likely to follow a variant pattern of development. Of the existing models of hemispheric specialization, Annett's right-shift hypothesis seems to be the most congruent for the results obtained in this study.

Subjects included 122 fifth-grade students and 126 seventh-grade students in the same rural school district. Each subject listened to six short stories representing African-American, Hispanic, and White cultural groups. After listening to each story, subjects wrote a free response and then rated the story. Overall the level of aesthetic involvement was not significantly influenced by the culture of student or text. Students from all cultural groups tended to go beyond simply retelling story events and showed evidence of responding aesthetically to the stories by mentioning specific parts, making judgements, reflecting on the story world, relating something in the story to the real world, and drawing inferences. Analysis of the focuses revealed grade level differences with a decrease at the seventh-grade level of responses focusing on the story world and an increase in making judgements. Only the focus which dealt with reflecting on the story world revealed a significant relationship between culture of student and text. With respect to preference, results revealed that a significant interaction was evident for grade by story ethnicity. Fifth graders strongly preferred White stories, while seventh-grade students preferred stories containing African-American characters. There was also a significant interaction for student ethnicity by story ethnicity. Students of minority cultures strongly preferred stories portraying their own culture while White students, although they preferred White stories, were more homogeneous in their preference. Book was also a significant main effect. Implications of this study are that although students of different ethnicities prefer stories reflecting their own culture, they are able to have complex aesthetic transactions to works regardless of the culture portrayed. This supports the integration of multicultural literature into the curriculum because literature affords all students opportunities for rich experiences with literature and allows students of differing ethnicities to enjoy the books reflecting their own cultural heritage.","Ph.

We make use of a unidirectional dual bus as the network topology and develop a medium access control (MAC) layer that is a hybrid of random access and implicit token passing schemes. Due to its hybrid nature, the proposed MAC eliminates the single station throughput problem of token passing protocols, while it retains high utilization under heavy loading.  We describe the proposed medium access control in detail using state transition diagrams and discuss implementation aspects of the MAC. We then investigate performance of the proposed system via both analytic evaluation and Monte Carlo simulation. The maximum channel utilization and an upper bound on the access are obtained under a heavy load assumption. An approximate analytic model of the proposed system under light to medium loading is developed, and the channel utilization and the average access delay are obtained using a Laplace transform method. Although the analytic model is based on several unrealistic assumptions, it appears to retain the basic characteristics of the proposed system. The performance characteristics of the proposed system are investigated and compared to those of Expressnet via simulations. Unlike other hybrid systems where performance rapidly degrades as load increases, the proposed system outperforms Expressnet over a wide range of loads. It is also shown that the proposed system provides more bandwidth to stations performing file transfers when compared to Expressnet. For instance, under the proposed system, five clustered file transfer stations achieve a channel utilization of 0.75 whereas they achieve only 0.53 under Expressnet. We consider three methods which improve the utilization-delay performance, namely, channel selection, packet removal at the regenerating station, and two-way token passing under heavy loading.  The proposed system is extended to support integrated traffic more effectively. To do this, a priority scheme is incorporated into the proposed MAC with minor modifications. The maximum number of isosynchronous sources satisfying a delay bound and the minimum guaranteed bandwidth allowed to asynchronous sources are derived. The priority scheme of the proposed system is compared to those of Expresssnet and FDDI via simulations for the integration of voice and data traffic. It is shown that the proposed system has a larger voice capacity than Expressnet and it is more flexible in assigning bandwidth to data stations than FDDI. For instance, the voice capacity of Expressnet is only 38% of that of the proposed system when the maximum allowable delay for the speech sample is 10 ms.","Ph.

Three canyon shapes were employed: a slot, a slot with exponential slope, and a depression with Gaussian cross-sections. The canyon width relative to the first baroclinic deformation radius was varied to see if a narrow canyon influences the flow less than a wide one. The models were forced using a geostrophically-balanced jet, oriented northward, normal to the canyon's principal axis. Simulations ranging in length from 30 to 50 days were made. The response has phases which are best classified according to time-scales. The initial response occurs within 2 inertial periods. During this phase the jet reacts strongly to the canyon by deflecting in a direction consistent with the notions of conservation of vorticity and contour following flow. A double Kelvin wave (DKW) forms over each canyon wall. The upstream DKW propagates offshore and is lost. The downstream DKW travels toward the coast where its energy accumulates. Some of this energy escapes as Kelvin waves. During the second phase, characterized by a slow vortex-stretching time-scale, closed circulations form over the shelf and canyon. The extent of the patterns inside the canyon and the degree of their organization appears to be related to the canyon's width; wider canyons contain better organized flow. The shelf flow patterns are more a result of the proximity to the domain ends than the canyon's width. An interesting phenomenon is the generation of freely-translating eddies which form at the canyon-coastline junction. They form as fluid is moved from the canyon onto the shelf by the cross-step velocity of short wavelength DKW. These anticyclonic features leave the canyon within 6 days. Their radius is the local deformation radius. Lagrangian tracers verify that fluid in the anticyclone is from the canyon...","Ph.

ISSG uses ERH to generate steam in-situ for steam flooding. The heat generated by ERH comes from the flow of low frequency electrical current through the formation. The ERH process has been studied by several authors[^1'13]. Previously studied applications of the ERH process have concentrated on oil production wells and water injection wells. These applications have mainly been conducted below the boiling point of water to avoid the problem with increasing formation resistivity due to water vaporization. The objective of this work was to study the engineering aspects of the ISSG process. A numerical finite difference 2-D, r-z simulator was developed for this study. The simulator consists of a fluid and energy flow model, an electrical flow model, and an over and underburden model. This study considered two processes: A) single injection well and B) cyclic steam injection. A variation of the Fourth SPE comparative study^16 was used as the base case. For the single injection well process, the variables studied were electrode length, electrode placement, injection interval, and ERH rate. For the cyclic steam injection process, the variables studied were heating during the production cycle, rate of ERH, and rate of water injection. The ISSG process may be used as an alternative to conventional steam injection (CSI) when either physical or environmental restrictions prohibits the use of CSI. The fuel cost ratio of the ISSG process to CSI appears to be at least 5.5. The steam injection study indicates that the efficiency of the ISSG process increases by decreasing the length of the electrode. The study also shows that water vaporization can be controlled by limiting water the injection interval to the electrode interval. The cyclic steam injection work show that: 1) heating during the production cycle is very ineffective, 2) the effect of increasing the electrical power is most effective when no steam is present during the injection cycle, and 3) the effect of increasing the water injection rate is most effective when steam is present during the injection cycle.","Ph.

One aspect of this dissertation was to assess the utility of an in vitro induction bioassay to accurately estimate the toxicity of a complex environmental mixture of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The bioassay analysis of Great Lakes fish extracts and extracts from pyrolysed brominated flame retardants gave results comparable to those obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) chemical analysis and in vivo toxicity studies, thus validating the utility of this bioassay for assessing the potential toxicity of complex environmental mixtures. The in vitro induction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity is a receptor-mediated response analogous to the regulation of genes by steroid hormones and their receptors. This structure-dependent response appears to require ligand activation of Ah receptors and is not the result of differences in: 1) molecular properties, 2) capability to initiate transcription and/or 3) rates of processing of nuclear Ah receptor complexes. Like the steroid hormone receptors, the accumulation of nuclear Ah receptor complexes is enhanced in a dose-, time-, structure- and cell-dependent manner by DNA intercalators and protein synthesis inhibitors. These studies revealed a high level of nuclear Ah receptors and suggest that these effects were the result of both stabilization of receptor complex-DNA interactions and inhibition of protein synthesis. The induction of AHH and EROD activity by 2,3,7,8-TCDD can also be antagonized by 6-methyl-l,3,8- trichlorodibenzofuran (MCDF) and its iodinated analog 6-methyl-8-iodo-l,3- dichlorodibenzofuran in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

Previous studies have suggested that a very high localized concentration of the hydroxyl radical produced by the radiolysis of water can react with atmospheric trace gases such as SO2 and produce lower vapor pressure compounds that can subsequently nucleate. To determine the trace gas and water vapor concentration dependence of the active, positively charged, first decay product of radon, a well-controlled experimental chamber, the Illinois-Clarkson system, was used in this research. The mobility spectrum of the decay products in the range of 0.07-5.0 cm^2/V*sec from the Illinois-Clarkson radon chamber was measured using a specially-designed mobility spectrometer. Measurements were taken for different relative humidities and concentrations of SO2 in purified, compressed air. The mobility of a new-born Po-218 ion measured by the spectrometer was determined to be 1.92 cm^2/V*sec. A comparison of the theoretical and measured alpha track densities was completed to investigate the performance of the ion spectrometer. The resultant mobility spectra at low and high humidities were compared. A Condensation Nuclei Counter (CNC) was used for counting condensation nuclei in each experiment. In the case of low humidities, the reduction of available hydroxyl radical concentration, and hence the neutralization rate, leads to an increase of the shoulder around 1.35 cm^2/V*sec with increasing SO2. This suggests SO2 clustering around the PoO[x]+ ion. For a high humidity condition (5 ppm SO2, 30 % RH), there was clear droplet formation, H2SO4 clustering around the ion and also an increase in the background level between the high mobility peak and the droplet peak.

Consequently, this study was conducted to: 1) validate of the use of rat mediobasal hypothalamic (MBH) slices in a perifusion culture system to study LHRH release and 2) investigate the involvement of and possible linkage between AC and PI in LHRH release. MBH from male rats were placed in 500 p.1 perifusion chambers and perifused at a rate of 25 μl/min with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate media (5.5 mM glucose) at 37° C under an atmosphere of 95% 02:5% CO2- Effluent fractions were collected into tubes on ice over 30 min intervals. Treatment compounds were introduced between 210 and 330 min of perifusion, while control tissues were left untreated. LHRH content (pg/30 min) of the fractions was determined by validated radioimmunoassay. Area under the LHRH release curve was determined using the trapezoidal rule. Sliced MBH (4 MBH units/chamber) demonstrated greater (P<.05) depolarization-induced LHRH release when compared with intact MBH. All subsequent experiments utilized 3 sliced MBH per chamber. Tissues from adult male rats did not respond (P>.1) to either 60mM K+ or 3 μm PGE2 compared to controls. MBH tissues obtained from immature rates responded (P<.05) to 60 mM K+, but were unresponsive (P>.1) to 3 μM PGE2 treatment. However, a 30 μM dose of PGE2 induced (P<.01) LHRH release from the MBH of immature rates. Tissues sliced in a transverse plane released more (P<.01) LHRH in response to 60 mM K+ than those sliced in a sagittal plane.

Because it is an internal and often solitary process, we still have much to learn about the development of written language. According to Piaget and others, most adolescents have reached the point of becoming independent agents in their cognitive development; however, national reports and other research findings show poor results in adolescents* abilities to express themselves effectively in writing. Findings suggest that it is often during this critical period that the least developmental work in writing occurs and that writing evaluation and feedback to students are frequently counterproductive. This study explores the effects of strategies that current theory in developmental psychology, composing, and creativity propose to be effective with students of this age group. These strategies include active involvement in learning, facilitative and directive feedback, and a gradual shift of responsibility for learning and performance to learners themselves. In this study, such strategies were implemented in regular classroom settings by three language arts teachers with 160 sixth grade also explores the likelihood that when students gain in one of these outcome variables they also gain in the others and, further, that students' first language relates in some way to the reported outcomes. For this study, strategies were implemented through a writing program in regular classroom settings by three language arts teachers with 160 sixth grade students. The program was implemented over a seven-month period. Sixty-five percent of the study population was characterized as low SES, and approximately 60% was non-Englishspeaking. The outcomes of the three key variables were measured using a series of five writing events as well as tests of writing apprehension and verbal creativity. The data were analyzed by examining students' gains on these measures. Teachers and classes were compared for possible replication of the outcomes of the writing program. Findings suggest that, when the writing program strategies were implemented, students showed gains in the variables of interest - writing achievement, attitude toward writing, and verbal creativity - and that, as a group, the non-English-speaking students made greater gains on these three criteria than did their English-speaking classmates.","Ph.

These findings are consistent with the variability of practice hypothesis derived from schema theory (Schmidt, 1975, 1976) , in which movement production is based on a generalized motor program (GMP) and variable practice leads to a stronger, more robust schema than specific practice. The purpose of the present experiments was to reinvestigate the variable practice effect found by Shea and Kohl (1990,1991) and to examine whether manipulations of practice composition would have effects on the learning of GMP and parameter specification. Subjects practiced either a single movement (C) or three movement patterns (A, C, & E) with the same relative forces and the same relative timing, but with different absolute forces (Exp. 1) or different absolute timing (Exp. 2). Retention was assessed on task C. The retention results indicated that the specification of the fixed parameter was facilitated by variable practice with the parameter that was varied during practice. However, overall proficiency analyzed by RMS error and the learning of GMP assessed by scaled RMS error failed to indicate the benefit of variable practice on retention. These results are inconsistent with the findings of Shea and Kohl (1990, 1991) in terms of overall performance and Wulf and colleagues (Wulf & Lee,1993; Wulf & Schmidt, 1989, 1993; Wulf, Schmidt, & Deubel, 1993; Wulf, 1992) in terms of the learning of GMP.","Ph.

One hundred eighty instruments were returned between July 19, 1991 and September 6, 1991. The questionnaire was tested for face validity and reliability. The findings suggest that there was no significant difference among the perceptions of individuals employed by governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, university research programs, and university administration concerning gender issues. Further, no significant difference existed between the perceptions of individuals located in the United States and Canada and individuals located outside of the U.S. and Canada. The decision makers held generally positive opinions about working with women's programs. They recognized the importance of gender issues, and identified their perceptions of the most critical needs. They also recognized the obstacles that prevented those needs from being met. Their perception was that only 17% of women's needs are being met by current international projects. These decision makers recognized that a woman's day is fractured into many activities. The most time consuming activities were identified as food production, fuel harvesting, and water hauling. Women targeted to benefit from development projects were perceived by these decision makers as having numerous positive attributes; however, these high praises were balanced by the recognition that serious negative factors were also at work, such as cultural and traditional beliefs.

In order to accomplish this purpose, the researcher sought answers to the following questions: 1. What are principal and teacher attitudes toward the appraisal process? 2. Are principal and teacher attitudes the same toward the appraisal process regardless of school district size? A five-point Likert scale was used to assess educators' attitudes. Four hundred Texas school districts were randomly selected to receive questionnaires. Three principals and three teachers (one each at elementary, middle, and high school levels) received questionnaires. Two hundred thirty-five districts responded to the survey. Data were analyzed to obtain frequencies, percentages, means and standard deviations for responses and an analysis of variance was conducted to determine differences between and within groups, especially with regard to school district size. Half of those responding were unsure of the clarity of House Bill 72 or felt it was unclear. The majority of educators agreed that the career ladder had a dual purpose--to maximize professional growth through diagnosis and prescription and to provide monetary rewards for exceptional teachers. Teachers are strongly in favor of their involvement in the development of the appraisal process. Both teachers and principals believe that the trained principal should have major responsibility for the appraisal process. Differences in attitudes toward commitment to funding, use of a single evaluation instrument, qualifications for appraisers, and selection of appraisers by teachers are all affected by district size. The most meaningful finding with regard to practical significance was differences in attitudes between teachers and principals toward teacher selection of appraisers. One of the main implications of this study is that its substantive, long-term success could be seriously impaired because the majority of principals and teachers surveyed did not feel informed or significantly involved in initial implementation of change. Several specific recommendations for additional research related to educators' attitudes toward change and increased involvement in change were suggested.","Ph.

A dynamic optimization model was developed as the principal product of this research. The dynamic model's control objective is to provide maximum system productivity as well as minimum delay for a selected roadway system. A special feature of this model is its ability to manage queue lengths on external approaches up to predetermined upper limits. The model formulated to handle problems involving two intersections was extended to control three different roadway types: a conventional diamond interchange, a three-level diamond interchange, and an urban arterial with a critical intersection. The optimization model took the form of mixed integer linear programming. The control strategies generated by these modified dynamic models were compared with those derived from conventional signal timing models, using the TRAF-NETSIM microscopic simulation model. It was found that the modified dynamic models successfully produced optimal signal timing plans for the various oversaturated signalized intersections. The dynamic models consistently outperformed the conventional models with respect to system productivity. This conclusion was drawn from the TRAF-NETSIM simulation. The dynamic model solutions significantly reduced total system delay for most test cases, while slightly increasing the delay for a few test cases. Queue management on external approaches is a primary concern in the control of congested signalized diamond interchanges. The dynamic model was found to be superior to the conventional models in queue management for the congested interchanges. Queue spillback to upstream intersections is a major concern in the arterial systems having a critical intersection. The dynamic model solutions produced a significantly smaller queue spillback than the conventional model, TRANSYT-7F. The dynamic model controls queue lengths by the efficient and timely changing of signal timing plans as demand changes. The traffic control strategies presented in this research were also designed to minimize the transitional delay from frequent changes of the timing plans. The control strategies appeared effective in reducing this delay.","Ph.

Photosynthesis and respiration were determined by the CO2 exchange using the infrared gas analysis technique. Growth and development were evaluated by measuring agronomic characteristics and leaf stage, respectively. The yield performance was estimated by measuring yield characteristics. Short term high temperature in the vegetative stage did not affect yield characteristics. Variations of agronomic characteristics and development patterns occurred for short period of time after treatments, suggesting that growing points and some metabolic activities may be injured rather than the carbon balance. High temperature in the grain -filling stage affected yield through lower spikelet numbers, high percentage of sterility and reduced grain weights. Diurnal changes of stomatal conductance were observed under controlled environments. A decreasing trend of stomatal conductance was found in the vegetative growth phase. Conductance increased dramatically from panicle initiation through heading to early grain -filling, which may be a compromise of its own carbon economy. Stomatal movements of rice plants were sensitive to temperature changes. High temperature stimulated the opening of stomata yet preserved diurnal pattern of stomatal variations. High temperature enhanced the CO2 exchange rates in both stages. Temperature effects on the carbon balance were through the changes of the relationship between growth and maintenance. Differences in the daily gain of carbon between treatments depended on the counterbalance of synthetic rate versus respiration rate. The yield of growth was little affected by temperature yet increased slightly from young plant to matured plant, suggesting changes in the com position of biosynthetic end products. High temperature increased maintenance coefficient (m) because metabolic rate increased with increasing temperature. The value form decreased from the vegetative stage to the grain -filling stage, suggesting changes of the protein fraction and composition. Substrates consumed in respiration were utilized more in maintenance than in growth. High temperature enlarged the respiration differences. Obviously, less biomass was produced from the available substrates consumed in heat-treated plants of a greater demand for maintaining the existing plant biomass.","Ph.

Reducing the number of participants in a usability test or using heuristic evaluation are the two approaches most often associated with discount methods. In this dissertation, an alternative heuristic method was developed based on the concept of a double specialist (knowledge of usability techniques and of a software product domain). Double specialists were previously shown to provide heuristic evaluation superior to that of regular usability professionals, primarily because of their knowledge of usability problems typically found within the given domain. Similar knowledge, based on competitive usability testing, was used to devise a domain-specific heuristic checklist. The product domain chosen for the research was online calendars. The calendar checklist was compared to general heuristics and to streamlined usability testing with two usability test subjects. Fifteen software developers and fifteen usability professionals were each randomly assigned to one of the three evaluation methods. They were then provided with a previously unseen software calendar and were asked to find as many usability problems as possible. Participants using the calendar checklist found more total problems, and a significantly higher percentage of user-oriented problems and severe problems than did those using the general heuristic method, suggesting that domain-specific heuristics do provide an improved heuristic approach. Streamlined usability testing, however, was found to be the most effective discount usability method. Usability professionals and software developers did not differ in their ability to find user-oriented or severe problems. It was concluded that when time and resources permit, usability testing is the method of choice. When user testing is not feasible, however, domain-specific heuristics may provide results approaching the effectiveness of the double specialist.","Ph.

The risk of injury to the low-back is increased in the deadlift due to the heavy loads that are lifted. While it is generally accepted that the traditional style deadlift creates a greater force on the 1umbo-sacral articulation than the sumo style, the actual forces incurred during the deadlift have not been determined. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the traditional and sumo style deadlifts with respect to lumbo-sacral forces and angular positions and velocities of the relative trunk and knee. Subjects were competitive traditional (n=4) or sumo (n=4) style deadlifters. The subjects were videotaped with an Olympus VHS movie video camera operating at a speed of 30 frames per second while performing three lifts at each of three weights (40, 60, & 80% of maximum) with a five minute rest between each lift. Coordinate data for the start, mid-point, and end of each lift were collected using a Targa 16 image capture board. Joint centers for a the ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, and the bar were digitized. The resultant muscle force, compression force, and shear force at the lumbo-sacral articulation were determined. In addition, the angular positions and velocities of the relative trunk and knee were obtained. For each variable, the average of the three trials per weight was used in the analysis. The traditional and sumo deadlifts were found to differ with respect to the resultant muscle force, compression force, and angular position of the relative trunk. No differences were found between the two lifting styles for shear force, angular position of the knee, or angular velocities of the relative trunk or knee. Evidence was found to suggest that traditional style deadlifters may be more prone to muscle strain and compression injuries at the L5/S1 articulation than are sumo style deadlifters. Evidence was also found to suggest that large incremental increases in the weight of the load may increase the risk of muscle, compression, and shear injuries to the lumbo-sacral articulation.","Ph.

This study investigates the capabilities of the reflective data of the NOAA-n Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to detect and map features associated with phytoplankton concentrations at the ocean surface. Considering the capabilities of satellite observation for this problem, the more accessible data sets from the NOAA-n AVHRR are examined, and techniques designed to exploit the full sensitivity of the instrument are introduced. These procedures include an editing technique that maintains the full resolution in the low albedoes pertaining to ocean targets and a normalizing procedure to account for atmospheric contributions to the signal. The atmospheric effects are treated as functions of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere and the position of the individual pixels along the swath width of the instrument. These techniques permit the refinement of the reflective data to 0.1% albedo and the expansion of acceptable data to at least 512 pixels on either side of nadir. Data obtained with these methodologies are compared with near-simultaneous and pigment calibrated Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) data. These two sets of data are segmented using a mathematical classification technique and then compared to determine similarity of spatio-temporal features. To verify the AVHRR findings, these data are compared to concurrent in-situ data from two red tide incidents in the eastern and western coasts of the Gulf of Mexico during 1983 and 1986, respectively. Comparisons are also made between AVHRR reflective and emittive data to investigate possible relationships existing between the circulation patterns and phytoplankton distributions.","Ph.

FTMP provides distributed reliability services to application programs in a highly redundant, loosely coupled, distributed network. Design goals for this research included network and location transparency for the applications; topology and operating system independence; the ability to diagnose, contain, and recover from both hardware and software failures; and provision for future protocol extensions. The goal of topology independence is significant in that it prevents the use of existing network broadcast and routing services, while offering the use of much more fault tolerant network designs, such as planar-2. The design approach used includes both the addition of new vertical operating system layers, as well as full distribution and data replication for these new services. Vertical layering is used to place fault tolerance appropriately. While many prior efforts have centered only on hardware based methods, or application based methods, this approach recognizes that fault tolerance is needed in all levels, including hardware, device driver, operating system kernel, library, and application layers. In addition, two new layers are added between the application and traditional operating system, to provide desired new distributed services. The specific design provides the necessary operating system extensions with one service daemon per node. This daemon implements FTMP in a fully distributed fashion. In addition, an interface library is provided which simplifies the application's use of the FTMP services, while also implementing some of the fault tolerance services on a per application basis. Together, the interface library and service daemon provide automatic detection and correction of hardware and software failures, location transparent communication through distributed named ports, automatic critical file remote replication, and distributed object handling.

It consists of a birefringent optical fiber embedded in an aluminum acoustic waveguide. Light with a wavelength of 1.3 μm enters the input fiber polarized along one of its principal axes and is coupled to the orthogonal axis by the induced birefringence produced by a traveling ultrasound wave. This acousto-optic interaction shifts the frequency of the light by the frequency of the acoustic wave, in the vicinity of 1 MHz. Different prototypes were fabricated, and sideband suppression of 30 dB and carrier suppression of 26 dB were measured, using 500 mW of electrical driving power. The fabrication of this frequency shifter was made possible by the development of a process that allowed for the first time the embedding of optical fibers in aluminum. The resulting device is very sturdy and easy to fabricate, in contrast to alternative types of fiber-optic frequency shifters.","Ph.

Cited research indicated drilling temperatures are related to many plated-through-hole defects. This investigation was divided into three phases: developing a suitable on-line measurement system, documenting sensor responses, and evaluating the sensitivity of temperature to a comprehensive set of drilling factors. Six data sets were generated. Four documented sensor responses and sources of measurement error including; peak entry and exit temperatures for a 2500-hit drill run at constant speed and feed, time traces from individual drill cycles for temperature and a complex pressure foot-thrust force, bit emissivity measurements, and data demonstrating the significant effect of IR probe position on exit temperature. Sensitivity of temperature to several drilling factors was evaluated in two designed experiments for 18-mil and 42-mil solid carbide designs drilled in FR-4 multilayer panels. Factors included: surface speed, chip load, head height, number of panels, hits, and localized differences in layer geometry. Measured responses included; thrust force, bit temperature, and changes in bit relief areas. A unique blocking methodology was used in these designed experiments. Balanced factor combinations were distributed in small blocks through the linear response region of each bit. All bits exhibited dynamic temperature cycling with cooling between holes exceeding 70°C. Measured emissivity changes were minimal. Bits of different design/diameter exhibited different responses. 42-mil designs showed large nonlinear increases in temperature during break-in followed by linearly increasing response in later hits. Within 200-hit blocks 42-mil response was sometimes nonlinearly increasing or decreasing, and exhibited positive and negative changes in slope. 18-mil designs produced relatively linear responses with slightly negative overall slopes. In general, temperatures were affected most by bit design/diameter, stack, height, percent copper layers, chip load, and speed. Temperature was affected least by head height, variations among bits of the same design, and higher order interactions.","Ph.

There was greater agreement between ACT2 teachers and pre-service teachers than between ACT2 teachers and the other groups as to the number of technical and laboratory teaching competencies needed to teach Chemistry I. Chemistry majors reported having more of these competencies than other science majors or education majors. Unsolicited comments showed that many ACT2 teachers applauded the establishment of a list of needed technical and laboratory teaching competencies.

The studies were conducted in the 1985-86 and 1986-87 production seasons, at three locations in Central and South Texas, areas prone to severe leaf rust epidemics. Individual experiments utilized either winter or spring wheat genotypes with differing combinations of resistance genes, grown both with and without fungicide treatment. Yields of winter wheat mixtures significantly higher than the mean for the component genotypes were obtained in two of five mixture experiments, both with and without fungicide treatment. Yield component analysis revealed that the performance of some genotypes in mixtures varied significantly from their performance in pure stands. Grain volume weights for mixtures were significantly higher than corresponding weighted means for the components in two of five mixture experiments, for both treatments in one experiment, and for the treatment without fungicide in the other. Severities of leaf rust in mixtures were significantly lower than those for the mean of the components in two of five experiments in untreated plots, and for one of the experiments, in fungicide treated plots as well. Areas under the leaf rust disease progress curves for mixtures were significantly lower than corresponding means for the components in untreated comparisons for three of five winter wheat experiments, and for the fungicide treated comparison in one of them. Grain yields of spring wheat mixtures did not differ significantly from the means for their components in any experiment. Volume weights of spring wheat mixtures significantly exceeded the mean for the components in two of four mixture experiments in the absence of fungicide treatment. In one of the four spring wheat experiments, the severity of leaf rust in mixtures which did not receive fungicide treatment was significantly lower than the mean for the components, while in another of these experiments, the level of leaf rust for the mixture was significantly higher than the mean for the component genotypes. The areas under the leaf rust disease progress curves were significantly lower for mixtures than for the component mean in two experiments for the treatment which did not receive fungicide, and significantly higher for the mixture than the component mean for the same treatment in another experiment.","Ph.

The acidity is a product of FeS2 oxidation. Mixed overburden topsoil substitutes containing FeS2, are often limed to prevent acid minesoil formation. The main objective of this study was to measure the effects of liming rates on the kinetics of FeS2 oxidation in overburden. To accomplish this objective, two overburden materials with different FeS2 content (1.9 and 4.1%) and low acid neutralization potential were limed with CaCO3. Lime rates of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125% were based on the amount of CaCO3 needed to provide an acid/base account (A/B[a]) of zero (A/B[a] = acid neutralization potential--Potential acidity--exchangeable acidity). The limed overburdens were inoculated with Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and leached weekly with deionized water for 53 weeks. Iron sulfide oxidation followed two different rate laws depending on the pH of the system. The oxidation followed zero-order kinetics with respect to FeS2 concentration at pH value above 4 and first-order kinetics below 4. The rate of oxidation was also found to differ with FeS2 source. The zero-order oxidation rate ranged from 0.01 to 0.46 μmol g^-1d^-1 in overburden 2 and from 0.01 to 0.22 μmol g^-1d^-1 in overburden 4. Oxidation following the first-order rate law had a first-order rate constant of 0.03 d^-1 in overburden 2 and 0.01 d^-1 in overburden 4. The calculated half-life is 23 and 69 d, respectively. Additions of CaCO3 affected FeS2 oxidation by controlling the pH of the system. The higher the pH the slower the oxidation. Liming to 25% of the A/B[a] deficit maintained the pH above 4 for approximately 100 d in overburden 4. At that time, oxidation changed from zero- to first-order. The addition of lime did not affect the subsequent half-life of FeS2 after the pH decreased below 4. Liming to greater than 50% A/B[a] deficit did not significantly affect the zero-order oxidation rate. The dissolution of the applied CaCO3 was found to be faster than the release of potential acidity. It is projected that the lime would dissolve out of the system before all the FeS2 would oxidize leaving the potential for acid minesoil formation.","Ph.

A major objective of the work was to identify a method that can be used to obtain a reservoir description in a coalbed methane reservoir. The methods proposed in the literature for estimating properties of coalbed methane reservoirs were evaluated. A more specific objective was to validate the method chosen for coalbed methane reservoir description in a specific geologic location. A good reservoir description may help quantify an increase in the effective permeability of the coal natural fracture system. This will help us to understand the reservoir conditions where cavitation may be a suitable stimulation technique for coalbed methane reservoirs. As a result of this research, several observations about coalbed methane wells have been made. This research indicates that (1) cavitation alone cannot account for all the increased gas production, (2) the use of a reservoir simulator is necessary to obtain a reservoir description, (3) the cavitation process forms an altered zone, (4) existing analytical solutions do not accurately characterize the complicated flow of a coal reservoir, (5) interference tests should not be analyzed using conventional or pseudopressure methods to estimate permeability between coalbed methane wells because of gas saturation gradients, and (6) lab relative permeability data should not be used for the Fruitland Formation coal sample.","Ph.

At his death in 1770, he left behind approximately 110 published sermons. Seventy-five of these sermons were printed in The Works of George Whitefield, a six-volume edition of letters, journals, tracts, and sermons published in 1771 and 1772. While a few collections of his sermons were reprinted in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, there has been no edition of sermons using the principles of modern textual criticism. Moreover, no complete bibliography of his sermons exists. The aim of this dissertation has been to demonstrate the need for bibliographic and textual studies of his sermons. The descriptive calendar provides the scholar with a complete record of Whitefield's sermons published in English in Britain or in the American colonies in the eighteenth century. It consists of two parts: Individual Sermons and Sermon Collections. The record includes scripture texts and provides a cross-reference to collections. The descriptive calendar is an important step toward a descriptive bibliography of his sermons. The two sermons, The Marks of the New Birth and  A Sermon on Regeneration, are edited using the techniques of modern textual criticism. These editions demonstrate the need for new editions because the collation of the first published text with Works and other texts shows that Whitefield revised some of these later editions in response to his critics. According to modern textual theory, these revisions are self-censorship and the original passages should be restored. Thus, this dissertation points to the need for a full-scale edition of his sermons and a full descriptive bibliography.","Ph.

The first part of the study reveals that effectively twice the diversity is available using multilevel codes than using a simple binary to M-ary mapping. We note that the complexity of decoding the multilevel code is nearly identical to that of decoding the binary mapped code. The second phase of the dissertation focuses on concatenated codes. Of the five systems proposed, one achieves a ninth order diversity for a 4-PSK signal set while another one yields an asymptotic sixteenth order for the 8-PSK constellation. The decoding complexity of the ninth order system can be greatly reduced if staged decoding is used on the inner multi level code. Likewise, the sixteenth order system can be easily implemented using our own soft decoder for the inner even-parity subcodes. We also consider the performance of multilevel structures on a time-varying channel. A practical example is proposed for the radio mobile channel featuring data transmission from a broadcasting station to a moving vehicle. Three dB gain is achieved and a diversity of second order protects the information in the event of a fading. This system has a low complexity level, with a rate 1/2 4-state convolutional code at the first decoding level and a simple rate 1/2 zero-sum code at the second level. Optimal and suboptimal strategies are used to decode the multilevel codes. Hard decisions, soft decisions, and hybrid decoders are also investigated.","Ph.

The specific focuses of this research are capturing planning knowledge in selecting an appropriate equipment class, capturing planning experiences of allocating construction resources, and automating simulation studies. IRAS consists of three modules to accomplish the focuses of this research. These modules are an expert system, a pattern classification, and a Goal Driven Simulation System (GDSS). The functions of the expert system module are to capture planning knowledge in selecting a construction technology (e.g. scrapers) and an equipment class (e.g. conventional class of scrapers) and to recommend an appropriate equipment class based on process data (e.g. travel distance). The functions of the pattern classification modules are to capture the experiences of allocating construction resource, to recommend a preliminary resource assignment, and to adapt new experiences. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Backpropagation algorithm is used as the pattern classification tool. A justification for selecting ANN and Backpropagation algorithm is presented. The functions of the GDSS module are to allocate a final resource assignment and to automate simulation studies. GDSS consists of an integration of a simulation program and an analysis program that analyzes a simulation output and synthesizes an appropriate resource assignment. GDSS reduces the user's knowledge requirements in conducting simulation studies to specifying the goal (e.g. moving 300 CY/HR), the model data, and the number of equipment units. Using the goal as the ultimate objective, GDSS conducts a simulation study through alternating between the simulation program and the analysis program until the goal is satisfied and the assigned equipment are effectively utilized. The analysis and simulation programs are developed using C_language. The modules of IRAS prototype have been validated using an earthmoving process.

More specifically, this research seeks to determine whether birders along the upper Texas coast can be segmented into distinct experience groups, and further, whether significant differences exist among the groups in terms of their motives for birding, knowledge and skills in birding, degree of commitment to birding, and preferences for management setting attributes. This study is based on two bodies of previous research. In a series of studies that dealt with various animal activity groups, Stephen Kellert developed a typology of scales to measure American's attitudes toward wildlife. These studies largely were concerned with Americans' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about wildlife and the environment. In this context, Kellert's research yielded insight about many characteristics of birders but left unanswered the question of why people participate in birdwatching. B. L. Driver and his associates have developed standardized scales to measure motives for recreation participation. These scales, called the Recreation Experience Preference (REP) scales, have been validated by a number of subsequent studies. In order to address some of the questions concerning birders, and to extend Kellert's work, the REP scales were used in this study to measure motives for birding and to identify distinct experience groups on the basis of motive differences. The following hypotheses were tested in this study: 1) birders along the upper Texas coast can be divided into distinct, relatively homogeneous segments based on differences in their motives for birding, and 2) each of these segments differs significantly from the others in terms of activities associated with birding, participation in outdoor recreation activities other than birding, preferences for specific managerial settings, and sociodemographic characteristics...","Ph.

All other glands associated with the mouthparts are most highly developed on a relative size basis in the minum caste and least developed in the queen caste.

Initiation of improvements in power output capacity will first involve identifying individual weaknesses in specific power parameters. This study was proposed to evaluate variations in power output between selected subjects. Characteristics of aerobic endurance and muscular strength were also examined for possible relationships to power parameters. Fifty-one male students aged 17-24 served as subjects in this investigation and were tested on three different occasions for predicted maximal oxygen uptake (predicted Vo2), isokinetic strength, and short-term power output. Pearson correlation and analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures were performed on subject data (N=51) to examine power parameters. Peak power (PP) correlated with both average power (AP) and power decline (PD) while PD correlated positively with AP and negatively with time to peak power (TTPP) (p<0.05). Operationally defined groups of high and low PP differed significantly with regard to AP and PD means and operationally defined groups of high and low PD differed significantly with regard to TTPP means. Extension strength, predicted Vo2, and selected power variables were also evaluated by Pearson correlation procedures. AP and PP were both found to correlate significantly with slow extension strength (SEXT), fast extension strength (FEXT), and predicted Vo2. ANOVA procedures were then performed for SEXT, FEXT, and predicted Vo2 with regard to PP and AP levels. Findings suggested that subjects grouped high in PP and AP have similarly high extension strength capabilities. Based on the results of this investigation, it was concluded that there are differences in power parameters between selected subjects.

STM was proven to be a valuable technique in the determination of surface states in the semiconductor/solution interface. Here, a model was developed to characterize the electron tunneling process between the tip and the semiconductor. The effect of an oxide film on the electrode surface was considered. On the other hand, investigations using SBGP spectroscopy in the IR region considerably increased the resolvability of the energy range in which surface states can be determined. A surface state band was located at about 0.3 eV above the top of the valency band at the surface of the semiconductor. This band of surface states was induced in the oxide/solution interface. The dependence of both the energy position and density of surface states on the electrode potential and electrolyte strongly suggests that surface states were induced by adsorption of H atoms (an intermediate on the H, evolution reaction) on the electrode surface. Comparison between the dependence of both the H coverage and the density of surface states with the electrode potential supports the concept that surface states arise as a consequence of H adsorption.","Ph.

Current industrial alkylations use either H2SO4 or HF as a catalyst. Compared to the liquid catalyst, the use of a solid acid catalyst tremendously reduces or eliminates the potential hazard of large acid spills. In this study, a HY zeolite, sulfate-promoted titania, mixed oxide of TiO2/ZrO2, TiO2/Al2O3, and ZrO2 were synthesized. Two different sulfate-promoted zirconias, (MSG-ZrO2-S and PPT-ZrO2-S) were synthesized by the modified sol gel method and the precipitation method. The alkylation results indicated MSG-ZrO2-S had a significant larger butene conversion, C8 yield, and C8/C9 + ratio than PPT-ZrO2-S. MSG-ZrO2-S also had a larger C8/C9+ ratio than HY. MSG-TiO2-S and its related binary oxide were not active. MSG-ZrO2-S had more acid sites over the entire acidity range than PPT-ZrO2 -S. Compared to HY, MSG-ZrO2-S has a fewer number of weak and medium acid sites, as well as a greater number of strong acid sites. MSG-Ti02-S had the smallest amount of acid sites indicated by the ammonia TPD analysis. The reaction temperature significantly affected alkylation activity of HY. Butene conversion, C5+ yield, and n-butane production were dramatically increased with the increase of temperature with the decrease of C8/C9+. Isobutane to butene ratio had no significant effect on alkylation. A larger isobutane to butene ratio, however, was more favorable for the production of C8 than the production of light ends. All active catalysts used in this study showed rapid deactivation. The cause of deactivation is believed to be the deposit of polymer on the active sites. The experimental data obtained from HY-catalyzed alkylation were well fitted by the simulated results based on a simplified kinetic model. All 16 parameters used in the kinetic model were evaluated through the parameter estimation.","Ph.

The OH- radicals were detected by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy.  The ability of different types of metal oxides to produce gas-phase OH- radicals during the reaction of 0, with H 2 0 was examined. Surface-generated gas-phase hydroxyl radicals were formed at temperatures between 983 and 1250 K over 7 mg La 2 0 3 during the reactions of CH4+02, CH 4 +N2O and H 2 0+0 2' The activation energy for the production of hydroxyl radicals during these three reactions was approximately 40 kcal/mol.  It was determined that the OH- radicals were actually formed from the reaction 1/2H 2 0+1/40 2 @ OH-.  Evidence for the reaction being at equilibrium includes (i) the activation energy for hydroxyl radical production was equal to the heat of formation of OH- radicals from H,O with 0,; (ii) the orders of OH- radical production were those expected from the law of mass action; and (iii) the absolute concentration of hydroxyl radicals was the same as that calculated from thermodynamics. The production of OH, radicals was investigated over other rare earth oxides catalysts.  The strongly basic rare earth oxides, including La203, and Nd 203) produced hydroxyl radicals at equilibrium with 7 mtorr each of H2 0 and 0 2 and 7 mg catalyst at 1220 K. These catalysts also produced significant concentrations of methyl radicals during methane oxidative coupling.  The weakly basic rare earth oxides, Yb 203 and CeO2), did not produce any detectable hydroxyl radicals or any significant concentration of methyl radicals during methane oxidative coupling. The production of OH- radicals became kinetically controlled at higher pressures or when the amount of catalyst was decreased. The OH- radical production became zero order for both H,O and 0, and had an activation energy of 10 kcal/mol at pressures over 200 mtorr for a 1: I water-to-oxygen ratio.  When the amount of La 203 catalyst was less than 2 mg, the activation energy decreased from 45 kcal/i-mol to 31 kcal/mol as the total pressure was increased froi- n 50 mtorr to 120 mtorr.

Even small scale imagery such as advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) has been applied to continental vegetation mapping. Much has been written about how remote sensing can provide this kind of data for a GIS, however, little attention has been placed on the role of GIS for supplying data to automate the image classification process. Large data bases such as the USDA SCS National Resources Inventory (NRI) now being constructed have a potential for filling this role. The NRI has a potential for contributing to the improvement of vegetation mapping in at least three ways: Automated classification of imagery using NRI sample points to create training sets, classification verification through use of NRI sample points as field verification points, and automated map generation directly from the NRI data base through use of Thiessen polygons. Classification accuracy of a TM scene classified using NRI data to produce training sets was fair (43.6% overall classification accuracy), considering the process was completely automated with no human judgement involved. Adding ancillary data and temporal image information should improve this figure. Classification accuracy was tested for training sets of various sized polygons constructed around the NRI points. It was found that the smallest polygon (3x3 box) around each point resulted in a training set that produced the most accurate classification. Land use/land cover m aps can be easily generated from the NRI data base using the Thiessen polygon process. They provide a good overview of the conditions for a large area such as a state, however, for a county sized map, there are too few NRI data points to allow a reasonable depiction of the true conditions. Thiessen polygon maps do not depict accurate boundaries due to the process used for polygon generation, however, with the large number of sample points in the NRI, they provide a quick approximation of the conditions and have a potential for displaying land use/land cover change as the NRI is updated every five years.","Ph.

In this traveling wave photodetector structure the incident light interacts continuously with the optically generated microwave signal while they propagate along their own waveguides. Therefore, when the phases between the optical and microwave signals are matched, a strong traveling wave signal can be detected without losing its high speed and high quantum efficiency. Two types of photoconductive TWPDs, that is, symmetrical and asymmetrical TWPDs, are studied in this dissertation. DC and RF characterizations are carried out for these devices. Also, the interference effects are investigated with multiple input beams.  Since these TWPDs have planar structures, it is easy to integrate the TWPDs with other elements in Microwave and Millimeter wave Hybrid (MIC) and Monolithic (MMIC) Integrated Circuits such as GaAs Field-Effect Transistors (GaAs FETs). In this dissertation, an optical receiver is constructed by hybrid integration of the TWPD with a commercial low noise GaAs FET amplifier. A network, to match device impedances to the appropriate source or load impedances are designed and fabricated in microstrip on a semi-insulating GaAs substrate.  Microwave ring resonators for optoelectronic application are designed using CAD tools such as LINECALC and TOUCHSTONE, fabricated in our laboratory using photolithography process, and optically characterized using a modulated laser diode light source and a spectrum analyzer. A microstrip ring resonator and a new type of CPW-to-Slotline ring resonator monolithically integrated with a Schottky photodetector are investigated for optical excitation and nonlinear behavior. Harmonic signals are generated by optical excitation of the resonators at the fundamental mode. By mixing a local microwave signal with an optically generated RF signal in the vicinity of resonant frequencies of the resonator, new signals, which contain the sum and difference frequency of the two input signals, are generated. Also, nonlinear parametric amplification of optical RF input signal is investigated in both of the ring resonators with a local microwave pump signal.","Ph.

The null hypothesis of the study was that there would be no significant differences between the observed and expected values in regard to health education perceptions in terms of ethnicity. The study was conducted between September and December, 1992. The sampling plan employed was the utilization of a proportional stratified sampling of the base population. The villages, where the data were collected, were randomly selected. Questionnaires were utilized for data collection. A return rate of 99.08 percent was obtained. Analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). The Chi Square procedure was utilized to test the null hypothesis. Alpha was set a priori at 0.05. Overall Chi Square was reported in terms of ethnicity. Percentages were utilized to explain differences by gender and by age groups. The null hypothesis was rejected when the overall Chi Square was significant. The findings were discussed and generalized conclusions were reported. A reversal of response pattern either within an ethnic group or between ethnic groups was believed to be practically important to the health educator.

The simplicity in both motor design and power converter requirement along with the availability of high frequency, high power semiconductor switches have made SRMs compete with conventional adjustable speed drive technologies. The subject of winding current control in switched reluctance machines has always been associated with the shaft position information. The use of inductance for direct commutation control is the central subject of this dissertation. In contrast to the conventional methods based on position commutation, new methods of control based on inductance commutation are presented.  The object of a commutation algorithm is to switch the currents in the phase coils, in order to provide continuous energy conversion with maximum torque output for a given unit of input current. Since torque production in a SRM is based on the concept of variable reluctance, it makes more sense to observe the instantaneous phase inductance or reluctance instead of estimating the rotor position. The inductance sensors observe the machine parameters and provide sufficient information on the electrical characteristics of the coils. This control strategy avoids the inductance to position transformation blocks conventionally used in SRM control systems. In a typical SRM, the phase coils have a nonlinear behavior of inductance due to effects of current saturation. Also the parameters of one phase coil differ from those of the other due to manufacturing tolerances or due to bearing wear. In such cases, the algorithms written during the stage of manufacturing may not be valid after parameter changes. Optimizing torque production in the event of phase asymmetry and saturation is developed in this research.  Indirect sensors connected to the active phase coil of the SRM are based on sensing the flux level in the active coil. New commutation algorithms based on flux sensing concepts are derived and commutation based on observable phase coil parameters are developed. The commutation methods are based on a composite vector of the observable parameters of the active phase coil. These methods work on a tabular approach which is ideal for implementation using digital computers.","Ph.

From the earliest time points at which the proteins were detected, the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro), and cylindrical inclusion protein (Cl) were localized in the cytoplasm. The VPg/proteinase (NIa) and the catalytic subunit of the polymerase (Nib) accumulated in the nucleus. The sequence for the reporter protein β-glucuronidase (GUS) was fused to the sequences for NIa or NIb in a plant expression vector, resulting in synthesis of chimeric proteins in transfected protoplasts and transgenic plants. Both proteins mediated nuclear translocation of GUS, indicating that they have independent nuclear localization signals. To understand the factors that regulate the nuclear transport of NIa, transgenic plants that express genes encoding GUS fused to NIa or the 6/NIa polyprotein were generated. When located in a 6-kDa protein/NIa polyprotein, the 6-kDa protein impeded the nuclear translocation of NIa. The presence of free 6-kDa protein had no effect on NIa-mediated translocation. The 6-kDa protein and three polyproteins containing the 6- kDa protein were identified by affinity chromatography in extracts from infected plants. Two of these polyproteins contained NIa or the N-terminal domain of NIa (VPg). The subcellular localization properties of the 6-kDa protein were investigated by fractionation and immunolocalization of tissues from transgenic plants expressing 6-kDa protein/GUS fusion proteins. The GUS activity was detected in the cytosolic fraction (S30) of extracts derived from transgenic plants expressing non-fused GUS, while GUS activity was detected in the crude membrane fraction (P30) of extracts derived from transgenic plants expressing 6/GUS or GUS/6 fusion proteins. Transgenic plants expressing a GUS/6 fusion protein developed mitochondrial aggregates, and cytoplasmic membranous proliferations around and extending from the nucleus. The 6-kDa protein accumulated in these novel structures.

This is believed to be the first such simulator. To model paraffin deposition in the production tubing, a reservoir simulator is needed to accurately feed paraffinic oil into the annulus and the production tubing. A reservoir simulator that was developed by Ring was used. This simulator was modified and linked to an overburden and a wellbore simulators by using the principle of domain decomposition. By linking these three simulators, paraffin deposition is in the tubing was modelled. The removal of deposited paraffin was studied with one of the folowing three thermal methods: (1) a downhole heater, (2) the electric heating of the tubing, or (3) hot oil injection. To model these thermal removal methods, energy is added to the wellbore simulator in different manners each of which mimics one of the removal methods. Four cases, one depositional and three removal, are documented to illustrate the results obtained from this simulator. The conclusions were made by running the four cases and by developing the simulator. The following conclusions were made by running the four cases: (1) most of the precipitated paraffin is produced with the oil, (2) hot oil injected into the annulus may flow into the formation and reduce its effective permeability, however some damage may be removed by producing undersaturated oil, (3) downhole heaters take several hours to remove deposited paraffin near the surface and (4) electric heating of the tubing is a viable thermal removal process.

The dynamics of the system considered is modelled with as little simplifications and assumptions as possible to keep the problem tractable and at the same time physically realistic. Effects of geometric nonlinearity is taken into account. The hybrid governing equations are discretized by using the Galerkin's method. The flexible tether is also modelled as a series of beads which are connected in series by massless springs. Several tension and reel rate feedback control laws for deployment and retrieval are designed using Lyapunov's method when flexibility of the tether is neglected. It was found that the tension control laws designed for the simplified system can have a stabilizing effect on the vibrations of the tether. The performance of the full dynamic system with the designed control laws is investigated via simulations using both the Galerkin and bead model. At the same time, observations regarding the dynamics of the system and the validity of using the Galerkin's discretization procedure for a variable length tether are investigated. It is shown that the effects of geometric nonlinearity is significant during retrieval and that when geometric nonlinearity is included, an artificial instability is introduced into the Galerkin model causing sudden divergence of the system response during retrieval. This behavior is reproduced even for a simplified two dimensional example problem. It was found that the bead model produces a response that is physically realistic. Simulation studies using the bead model show that when reel rate control laws are used, vibrations grow to the point where the system becomes unstable. However, the tension control laws successfully retrieve the tethered subsatellite and were found to be effective in damping the elastic longitudinal vibrations in the early stages of retrieval. A nonrecursive order-N method for efficiently simulating the bead model is also introduced. The feasibility of implementing the order-N method for parallel computation is investigated using two parallel computer architectures. It was found that, due mostly to communication time, the use of the parallel computers do not offer any improvement in overall computation time.","Ph.

The literature addresses defining the at-risk problem, the consequences of the problem, and solutions to the problem. This research explores the impact on the students who attended an alternative school that individualized instruction by implementing cooperative learning, peer tutoring, and the use of simulations. The study unfolded in three phases: a) Phase I, collection and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative data related to the characteristics of the school and the student body; b) Phase II, examination of the implementation of the three innovative instructional strategies during one academic year, verbal portrayal of the environment and events of the year; and c) Phase III, the development of case studies of six former students. Four research questions sought to determine the effects of the school on the students in the areas of academic performance, development of creativity, social performance, and residual effects of the school. Findings presented are based on students' performance at entry into the program, during attendance at the school, and two years after leaving the program. The findings indicate that the academic performance of the students did improve while they attended the school. The development or enhancement of creativity was supported by events during the year and by the creative endeavors of the students today. The results of the study indicate that the social performance of the students improved in the areas of contact with law enforcement agencies and communicating with others while they were attending the school. Regarding the residual effects of the school, the students overwhelmingly stated that the school had made a positive impact on their lives today. They attributed this to the caring and concern of the teachers and staff of the school rather than to the innovative instructional strategies.","Ph.

One of the key features in both everyday conversation and the dramatic conversation in the Theater of the Absurd is repetition. In the plays of Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, and Edward Albee, repetition is a central stylistic feature of the dialogue. It operates on two levels in their texts: the micro level, between the characters, and the macro level, between the performance or text and the audience/reader. On both levels repetition creates both harmony and disharmony. On the micro level, repetition functions to create meaning and promote interaction between the characters, but it also signals discord between characters as well, because they use repetition to evade giving pertinent responses, to verbally dominate other characters, and to show contrived involvement. On the macro level, repetition creates harmony by involving us emotionally in the musical patterns of the dialogue, by bonding with the repetition of our everyday speech to produce dialogue that feels comfortable, and by making us laugh. Yet, repetition on the macro level also creates disharmony through too much repetition, or noise, and repetition that illustrates communication systems in a state of collapse. Repetition in the dialogue mimics the repetitive nature of ordinary talk and makes dialogue that should feel comfortable seem threatening, and it unsettles the spectator/reader because it captures our ambivalence about the communication process. What the spectator/reader remembers from this dialogue is not the rapport building nature of repetition but repetition that creates more distance between interlocutors in conversation, that feigns conversational involvement but actually brings anxiety.","Ph.

The functions of P. denitrificans cobI and S. typhimurium cbiL gene products were defined as S-adenosyl methionine dependent methyltransferases catalyzing C-20 methylation of precorrin-2 respectively. The S. typhimurium cbiA gene product was characterized as adenosyl triphosphate dependent cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase. It was proved that the S. typhimurium cbiF gene product catalyzes C-16 methylation of trimethylpyrrocorphin I to afford metal-free factor S3. Zinc insertion into the macrocycle took place non-enzymatically to produce factor S3, the zinc complex of a tetramethylated derivative of uroporphyrinogen I. The structures of precorrin-2, precorrin-3, factor II, factor III (intermediates of vitamin B12 biosynthesis), trimethylpyrrocorphin I (intermediate of factor S3 biosynthesis), and factor S3 derived from various 13C-enriched isotopomers of porphobilinogens were elucidated by 13C NMR. Successive addition of the electron donating methyl groups resulted in the changes in the conjugated array of C=C and C=N bonds of the main macrocycle, which were revealed in the NMR spectra. The differences between precorrin-2 and -3 or factor II and III in their 13C NMR spectra were attributed to the electron distribution of the macrocycle and the disruption of symmetry by C-20 methylation of precorrin-2. Careful consideration of line widths and the chemical shifts of their 13C signals indicate that precorrin-2 and factor II have time-averaged structures but that precorrin-3 and factor III have relatively fixed conjugation systems.","Ph.

Using a bovine-rodent hybrid somatic cell panel, the previous syntenic assignments for IFNA (U18), EFNB (U18) and IFNG (U3) were verified, and IFNO and IFNT were assigned to bovine syntenic group U18. Syntenic group U18 was subsequently assigned to bovine chromosome 8 by the fluorescent in situ localization of IFNO and IFNT genes to chromosome 8, band 13. With pulsed field gel electrophoresis, physical linkage among IFNA, IFNB, IFNO and IFNT genes was demonstrated. Bovine and ovine IFN restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were identified in Southern blots of genomic DNA using 35 (bovine) and 27 (ovine) probe-enzyme combinations. Following extended electrophoresis, the segregation of bovine RFLPs in 12 probe-enzyme combinations was followed through cattle pedigrees. Codominant segregation of alleles was found for 20 polymorphic IFN loci (5 IFNA, 4 IFNB, 8 IFNO. 2 IFNT and 1 IFNG). A total of 43 IFN genes (10 IFNA, 6 IFNB, 20 IFNO, 6 IFNT and 1 IFNG) were identified in Southern blots of bovine genomic DNA. A provisional genetic map for 8 polymorphic loci was constructed from the analysis of meiotic recombination frequencies in backcross cattle pedigrees. Genetic linkage was not demonstrated between brucellosis resistance and 20 IFN loci in cattle pedigrees segregating resistance to B. abortus as an autosomal dominant trait. However, statistical associations were observed between the presence of specific alleles at 1 IFNB and 2 IFNO loci and the severity of clinical disease following experimental infection with Bovine Herpesvirus-1.

Approximately 2,000 questionnaires were mailed to randomly selected Brahman, Beefmaster, Brangus, and Santa Gertrudis breeders throughout the United States. Field data were obtained from steers consigned to the 1991 and 1992 Texas A&M Ranch to Rail Program to ascertain the postweaning growth traits and carcass attributes of steers representing the surveyed breed groups as compared to their Bos taurus (British and Continental European) contemporaries. Steers consigned in 1991 were fed at Randall County Feedyard (n=467) in Amarillo, Texas, while the 1992 steers were fed either at Randall County Feedyard (n=663) or King Ranch Feedyard (n=517) in Kingsville, Texas. The evaluated breeders were attuned to the strengths and weaknesses of their breeds and repeatedly indicated that the maternal and adaptability characteristics of their cattle, coupled with their crossbreeding abilities, were the basic strengths of their breed and requested for their associations to promote the maternal ability of their breed to the commercial industry. The breeders were not only focusing on traits at the cow/calf phase but contend that the carcass characteristics of their cattle were negative attributes and require modification to maintain breed competitiveness within the next 10 yr. Evaluation of the field data demonstrated no discrepancy in carcass value due to breed characteristics. The Braham-influenced steers had acceptable carcass weights and desirable yield grades coupled with adequate quality grades. The net return from Bos indicus calves were compatible to the Bos taurus type calves, even though, the evaluated feedlot performance traites displayed a vast amount of variation from the Bos indicus calves. Calves with at least 50% of Brahman-or Santa Gertrudis-inheritance had the lowest feeder values.

The study evaluated the growth and production responses of kleingrass under early-season grazing to develop improved grazing management strategies. Specific objectives included: a) Identifying phenological development and rate of spring growth of kleingrass; b) Quantifying the growth characteristics of kleingrass measured at the tiller and sward levels; c) Testing quantitative hypothesis addressing growth and senescence of kleingrass under different early-season grazing treatments at the tiller and sward level; and d) Monitoring animal gains and intake, and relating them to plant growth response. The carrying capacity of kleingrass pastures increased by utilizing annual grasses as an alternative to herbicides for the control of these species. The 14-day delay, medium intensity grazing allowed a good harvest of annual grasses before they reached maturation, reducing competition from annual grasses. This maximized animal production and produced a low utilization of kleingrass at the beginning of the study when it was growing exponentially and increased utilization when it was growing linearly, reducing senescence losses. Since utilization of both annual grasses and kleingrass was adequate, average daily gains and gains per hectare were also optimized. The 14-day delay low intensity and all 30-day delay treatments resulted in under utilization of annual grasses, increasing competition from annual grasses and selective grazing of kleingrass. The low intensity treatments produced high average daily gains but low gains per hectare. The 30-day delay treatments resulted in low average daily gains and low gains per hectare. The high intensity and the 0-day delay treatments greatly reduced annual grasses, and thus competition, but imposed such severe grazing on kleingrass that standing crop was reduced. The high intensity treatments produced the lowest average daily gains. The medium intensity treatments produced the highest gains per hectare. The non-delay treatments produced high average daily gains and high gains per hectare.","Ph.

The model identified three independent variables which affect transaction costs in an employment relationship. These are, task visibility, skill specificity and task uncertainty. The three independent variables predict five dimensions of control. The dimensions of control are: situational control (monitoring), discretion, outcome-based rewards, professional control (enforcement) and inclusion (residual rights).

Task uncertainty was hypothesized to be negatively related to discretion and outcome-based rewards. Occupational socialization was hypothesized to predict cooperation. The degree of inclusion and professional control were linked to the peak and range of the production norm. Expected interaction effects were also specified.

Sialic acid derivatives with modifications at the C-5 and C-9 positions were synthesized by combined enzymatic and chemical methods. Sialic acid aldolase which catalyzes the aldol condensation of ManNAc and pyruvate has a broad substrate specificity, and is able to accept a variety of derivatives of ManNAc.

One key obstacle which has been identified in achieving parallel processing is to communicate effectively between processors during execution. The current research has focused on developing communication methods for parallel processors, which minimize the communication delay. For an N processors machine the optimal delay time is O(log N).  One approach to achieving an optimal delay time is to use expander graph. The networks and algorithms which are based on expander graphs are successfully exploited to yield fast parallel algorithms and efficient design. An important result in this research has been the introduction of the AKS sorting algorithm in time O(log N). This algorithm is based on the use of expanders. The expander graph also can be applied to construct a concentrator and a superconcentrator.  Since Margulis found a way to construct an explicit linear expander graph, several expander graphs have been developed. But the proof of existence of such graphs is in fact provided by a nonconstructive argument.  We investigate the expansion properties of the hypercube network. This is important because the hypercube network is one of the most versatile and efficient networks for parallel computation and is a very popular network in the commercial market. We prove the expansion of a single stage hypercube network and extend this from a single stage to multistage networks.

Spectroscopic studies indicate these peptides are able to adopt a #-sheet structure in aqueous solution.  Residue I nucleates #-sheet structure in aqueous solution through the formation of an intramolecularly hydrogen bonded hydrophobic cluster resulting from interactions between the dibenzofuran skeleton in residue I and the hydrophobic side chains of the a-amino acids flanking residue 1. The hydrophobic cluster acts as a nucleation site which is poised to facilitate    [ ]sheet folding once the charge density in the polycationic tridecapeptide sequence is lowered by adjusting the solution pH or increasing the ionic strength of the solution. Analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation studies reveal that the intramolecularly folded,6-sheet tridecapeptides undergo further self-assembly mediated by intermolecular lateral hydrogen bonding of the pepfide backbone.  This association ultimately yields a quaternary [ ]sheet structure which can be visualized by from electron microscopy studies. The incorporation of N-methylated amino acids into the peptide sequence serves to block the lateral hydrogen bonding network and has shown promise towards preventing p-sheet association.  The potential for the formation of the cisisomer about the N-methyl amide, however, can produce unwanted peptide backbone conformations.  Circular dichroism, NMR and analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation studies reveal that the N-methylated peptides are monomeric and adopt p-sheet structure, although not as well-defined as the associated #-sheets.  The [ ]sheet structure present in these N-methylated peptides can be further stabilized by increasing the temperature or by addition of trifluoroethanol. Relative and absolute reaction rates were determined in a systematic study of reagents and derivatives for the Barton-McCombie deoxygenation reaction.  Derivatives (S-methyldithiothionocarbonate, phenylthionocarbonate, 4-chlorophenylthionocarbonate, 4-fluorophenylthionocarbonate, 2,4,6-trichlorophenylthionocarbonate, 2,3,4,5,6 pentafluorophenylthionocarbonate, S-(2,4-ditnitrophenyl) dithiothionocarbonate, and N,N-(diethyl)-thionocarbamate) of model alcohols (cyclododecanol and cholesterol) were synthesized and reacted under standard conditions (100 'C or I 10 'C, AEBN initiator) with tributyltin hydride.  Rate data were obtained by quantitative IH-NMR. In nearly every case, Barton-McCombie deoxygenation was much faster than expected -literature methods generally advised reaction times of three hours or more.  Furthermore, there was little appreciable difference in reaction rates for most of the derivatives (first half-lives were about 0.5 - 1.0 min).  The xanthate (S-methyldithiothionocarbonate) reacted somewhat faster than any of the arylthionocarbonate derivatives - among these, a decreased reaction rate was noted for derivatives with greater electronegative substitution on the phenyl ring. Exceptions were noted in reactions of the S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) dithiothionocarbonate and NN-(diethyl)-thionocarbamate derivatives.  The NN-(diethyl)-thionocarbamate derivative remained essentially unchanged even after prolonged reaction times, while the S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) dithiothionocarbonate derivative reacted to give 2,4-dinitrobenzene and the starting alcohol instead of the expected deoxygenation product. Reaction rates were also obtained for the synthesis of several arylthionoformate derivatives of cholesterol (model alcohol).  The model alcohol was treated with pyridine and an arylchlorothionoformates (phenyl chlorothionoformate, 4-chlorophenyl chlorothionoformate, 4-fluorophenyl chlorothionoformate, 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl chlorothionoformate, and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl chlorothionoformate).  Rates for the acylation were measured under standard conditions (25 'C, CDC13 soln) using quantitative I H-NMR.  Acylation using 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl chlorothionoformate was much slower than with any of the other reagents (first half-life = 27 min).  Rates for the remaining reagents tended to increase with greater electronegative substitution on the phenyl ring.  First half-lives for these ranged from 0.5 - 3.5 min, with 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl chlorothionoformate reacting more than twice as fast as any of the other reagents. A new method for the synthesis of olefins from nitroolefins or (X-nitro alcohols was developed.  The reactions involved are quite mild. and the use of undesirable tributyltin hydride is avoided.  A pivotal step is nucleophilic Michael addition of S-ethyl trithiothionocarbonate to non-hindered vinylic nitroolefins.  The novel (x-nitro trithiothionocarbonate derivatives can generally be obtained in near quantitative yield without purification.  Radical-induced (visible light photolysis of 1-2 eq of N-(2-methylpropionyloxy)-pyridine-2-thione as radical source) elimination of the ethyltrithiothionocarbonate and nitro moieties gave olefins (mixture of E and Z) in good to high yields.  Olefins were prepared using several simple model compounds.  This method was also applied in the synthesis of 7,8-dideoxy-1,2:3,4-di-0-isopropylidene-(X-D-galacto-oct-6-ene-1,5pyranose.","Ph.

The experimental results are in good agreement with previous measurements in dilute solutions available in the literature. Stoichiometric activity coefficients for CO2(aq), HCO3-, and CO3[^2-] were calculated from these experimental data. Pitzer parameters for interactions between the carbonic acid species and major ions Na[^+], K[^+], Ca[^2+], Mg[^2+], Cl[^-], and SO4[^2-] were obtained by regression analysis. Experimental data at 25°C and 1 atm were used to evaluate Pitzer parameters in the literature. The Pitzer model, in association with the ion-pairing model and Pitzer parameter data sets from both Harvie's group and Pitzer's group, provides proper estimates of activity coefficients within the range of experimental uncertainty. The new Pitzer parameters for the carbonic acid system were consistent with parameters for other systems from either Harvie's group or Pitzer's group. A chemical model based on thermodynamic constants, and osmotic and activity coefficients estimated from Pitzer equations were found to predict accurately calcite solubility in the literature. Calcite solubility in synthetic brines (Na-K-Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4) was measured from 0 to 90°C in open systems from both undersaturation and supersaturation. It was found that calcite solubilities predicted using Pitzer model were generally in good agreement with experimental solubility data obtained from undersaturation. However, this was not the case when equilibrium was approached from supersaturation. The discrepancy between experimental data and predicted data may result from the fact that adsorbed and/or coprecipitated ions (such as Mg2+ and SO$[^2-]) on calcite surfaces tend to maintain a metastable equilibrium between the surface and bulk solution...","Ph.

Linearity of the transfer characteristic is also highly desirable; however the adjustment of previously-reported transconductors via adjustment of a tail current in a differential-pair-based input stage typically involves severe linearity degradation. The techniques presented in this work are based on the use of program m able current mirrors as a means of transconductance adjustment; furthermore, current mirrors are presented which actually perform the desired linearization of the currents generated by a simple differential pair input stage. This leads to fairly simply transconductor circuits which largely avoid the adjustment/linearity tradeoffs inherent in many previous designs. Experimental results verify the extended adjustment/linearization schemes.

Subjects for the study were from Dallas and Houston Regional Day School Programs for the Deaf and from Texas School for the Deaf, located in Austin. One hundred eighty protocols revealed Performance IQ and five subtest scaled scores for each subject; these constituted the six dependent variables. Analysis of Variance was used to investigate main effects for type of schooling and degree of loss on the dependent variables and possible interaction effects between the two factors (schooling and hearing loss). A one-sample t-test compared the Performance IQ (PIQ) mean and the subtest scaled score means of the study's sample to the WAIS-R PIQ mean of 100 and the subtest scaled score mean of 10 at the.05 and.01 levels of significance. Measures of central tendency and variability were used to examine patterns of performance. Results revealed no significant differences between test means on performance of deaf young adults for degree of hearing loss. Type of schooling yielded significant differences on the PA and BD subtests; however, less confidence can be placed on the PA subtest because of unequal variances. The study's sample scored statistically different from the means of the national normed group. There is a distinct pattern of performance as found in samples of deaf children. The group did not produce scores which ""fall toward the mean"" as suggested by the developmental theory that scores improve with age for deaf individuals. The unexpected finding that this sample of deaf young adults in Texas scored about one standard deviation below the norm negates the claim of Vernon and others that deaf individuals score within the normal range when non-verbal measures are used. Possible explanations for the discrepancy are presented as relating to such factors as the selection of tests, the individuals' approach to test-taking, skill of examiners, use of interpreters.

AMOS (Automated Multiple-Response Optimum-Seeker for Simulations) is an integrated system of Prolog and Fortran programs, implemented on a microcomputer, which seeks to automatically optimize a weighted linear combination of response variables produced by a constrained number of simulation runs. The available simulation runs are allocated to ""stages"" of the experiment. Within each stage, a modified Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is used to maximize a ""created"" objective function over a bounded search region. The size of the search region is reduced from stage to stage, until available simulation runs are exhausted, or desired convergence is achieved. AMOS automatically performs all the steps of the modified RSM. It generates the experimental designs and executes the simulations to produce the response variable observations. Each response variable is modeled and tested for ""fit"" using Least Squares Regression and Analysis of Variance. Failure of any one response model to ""fit"" causes AMOS to design and execute the next higher resolution experiment, up to a central composite design. The fitted models are ""weighted"" and summed to form the created objective function. The weights are normalized values derived from user-specified priorities. The created objective function is then maximized, over the current search region, using Golden Section Search or Canonical Analysis, as appropriate to the order of the polynomial model. The ""optimal"" point in any stage becomes the starting point for the REM in the next stage.

Experiments were conducted on etiolated seedlings grown in a standard nutrient solution to which NaCI was added. At concentrations of 100 mM NaCI, the sa stress did not inhibit root elongation, whereas the ss stress initially inhibited root growth. However, after 12 h, root elongation of salinized roots attained a rate of 2 mm/h, similar to control roots. Seedlings treated with 1 μM fluridone to block synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) resulted in reduced root elongation in control and NaCI-treated roots. Exogenous ABA at concentrations above 2.0 μM inhibited root elongation. The inhibitory effects of ABA on root growth were stronger than those effects due to 100 mM NaCI. Despite the gradual and sharp declines in root osmotic potential (ψπ) and water potential (ψw) in the 0 to 3 and 3 to 10 mm root zone, root turgor potential (ψp) remained constant in both salt stress protocols. The early- and long-term changes in ψπ in the 0 to 3 mm zone were associated mainly with the accumulation of Na+, K+, Cl-, and sucrose. Their contribution to ψπ (bar) was about -2.1, -4.2, -3.6, and -1.0 bar, respectively. In contrast, in the 3 to 10 mm zone, the contribution to ψπ (bar) was -2.2 (Cl-), -2.0 (Na+), -2.8 (K+), and -1.0 (glucose and fructose). The total contribution of inorganic and organic osmolytes to ψπ ranged between 70 to 90% of the estimated root ψπ.

Benzene is the most toxic and most mobile hydrocarbon constituent among these chemical. Benzene level in the contaminated soil from a spill can be used as a determining factor in selecting response actions for cleaning up the contaminated area regarding the protection of groundwater resources. This study developed cleanup criteria for oil and petroleum contaminated soils at spill sites. The maximum contaminant level (MCL) of benzene allowable in drinking water as established by USEPA was selected as a criterion to assess whether or not the groundwater will be contaminated as the result of the entering of benzene contained soil leachate at the spill site. If the anticipated maximum benzene concentration in soil leachate reaching the groundwater table is below the MCL, no action is needed to protect the groundwater and the natural degradation processes will take care of the spilled materials. If the anticipated maximum benzene concentration in soil leachate is close to the MCL when it reaches the groundwater level or there is no usable groundwater aquifers in the spill area, minor treatment actions can be taken to treat the contaminated soil on site; such as in situ bioremediation, in situ air-venting, surface covering, or addition of natural organic materials to the contaminated soil. If the anticipated maximum benzene concentration in soil leachate entering the groundwater will be much greater than the MCL and the groundwater resource is likely to be contaminated, major remedial actions will be needed. Should the remedial actions mentioned above be proven to be insufficient, contaminated soils will need to be removed from the spill site for off-site treatment at a commercialized treatment facility or disposal at a regulated hazardous waste disposal site.

Results support the hypothesis that deer are adapted to eating browse because of their ability to easily digest cell solubles and rapidly remove indigestible particulate matter. Results do not support the hypothesis that deer maximize phosphorus (P) digestibility at the expense of other nutrients to meet their P requirements. Dry matter intake(DMI) varied seasonally and was related positively to compartment turnover rate and negatively to the amount of cell wall in the diet. Mean in vivo dry matter digestibility (DMD) for the pelleted diet was 75.6%. Because of small condensed tannin (7.83 mg/g), lignin (2.62%) and neutral detergent fiber bound nitrogen (NDFN) levels (7 .88%), protein and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibilities in the pellet diet were high, 73.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Seasonal DMD for guajillo varied from 48.1% in the early spring to 35.2% in late summer. Blackbrush and brazil mean DMD were 36.3% and 49.1% respectively. Digestibility of the crude protein (CP) in guajillo varied from 45.8% in early spring to 13.7% in late summer. Low DMD and CP digestibilities were related to high condensed tannin (89.9 to 117.9 mg/g), and NDFN (46.2% to 54.0%) levels. Digestible energy (DE) was highly correlated with DMD (R2 = 0.99) for all diets. Mineral digestibilities were low for each diet except P which had strongly negative digestibilities.

The southern section of Death Valley basin is bordered by coalescing alluvial fans and is drained along its axis by the terminal end of the Amargosa River system. The terminal end of the Amargosa river was investigated with the following objectives: 1) to document the facies of an ephemeral stream in a hydrologically closed, pull-apart basin, and 2) to characterize its sand body geometries. The ephemeral fluvial system in southern Death Valley, California exhibits a succession of channel patterns and facies that can be divided into proximal, middle, and distal regions. The proximal region is narrow with steep gradient (3 to 5m/km), and is dissected by a single, straight braided channel with narrow, down-dip widening floodplain. The facies sequence in the proximal region is dominated by tabular lenses of crudely bedded gravel overlain by trough to planar cross-bedded coarse sand, and planar to ripple laminated fine sand. The proximal region grades down-dip into the low-gradient (0.5 to 1.7 m/km) anastomosing streams of the middle region. These anastomosing streams are characterized by interconnected networks of shallow, straight and meandering channels in a vast muddy floodplain. The straight channels have high width to depth ratio and are generally sandy; in contrast, the meandering channels have low width to depth ratio and are generally muddy. The migration of the anastomosing channels within the muddy floodplains produces isolated, thin (less than 1 m) sand bodies that are encased in a muddy facies. Their facies consist of massive to cross-bedded sand, ripple-laminated muddy sand, and wavy to planar laminated mud. The anastomosing system shows an overall decrease in its sand to mud ratio, and grades downdip into the nearly flat (less than 0.5 m/km) distal region.

Developed by the researcher, the study questionnaire was divided into three sections: general background data, 26 task statements, and an open-ended response section. The questionnaire was administered to 150 public school public relations directors who were members of the National School Public Relations Association (NSPRA). Responses (77% return rate) were analyzed using the Statistical Application System (SAS) computer program. Responding directors had similar backgrounds, were well educated, holding advanced degrees, held administrative team membership, possessed a degree in journalism, communications, English, or education, and were predominantly female (76%). For the most part the actual and ideal percentage of time directors spent on completing their tasks were unaffected by their varying educational levels and student enrollments. The most frequently performed (actual) tasks of the responding directors were preparing district-wide newsletters or newspapers, writing news releases, and coordinating communications to various media. While directors, for example, wanted more involvement in developing district-wide community programs, they wanted less involvement with traditional tasks, such as producing photographs and audio/visual materials. Open-ended responses that made task completion easier were having access to their superintendent and having the necessary computer equipment. A lack of staff, too many additional ""catch all"" duty assignments, insufficient time, and lack of funding were seen as making task completion difficult. Recommendations emanating from the study included focusing master's and doctoral level coursework for public relations directors on tasks identified as important in the study and having a greater rapport between NSPRA and the American Association of School Administrators to provide inservice for school administrators on the role of PR directors, task priorities, needed equipment, and necessary planning time.","Ph.

Since recovery of hydrate samples is very difficult using conventional geotechnical sampling operations the development of in situ detection methods becomes essential. In this research the electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of hydrates were studied experimentally using tetrahydrofuran as a hydrate former. An experimental apparatus was designed for this purpose and an automated control system was developed to form cylindrical specimens, freezing them unidirectionally from top to bottom. Massive hydrates and sediment-hydrate mixtures were formed and studied. The electrical resistivity of all hydrate specimens increased drastically upon hydrate formation to values that varied from 2x10^5 to 2x10^4 Ohm-m for frequencies ranging from 100 to 1000 Hz. The presence of brine in the specimens reduced the electrical resistivity and masked the frequency effects. The thermal conductivity was determined for steady state conditions in the cylindrical specimens by solving the three dimensional axisymmetric heat conduction problem and inverting the temperature data. The thermal conductivity of massive hydrate specimens varied from 0.18 to 0.48 Wm^-1K^-1 Sand- and clay-hydrate specimens had a thermal conductivity similar to water saturated specimens, increasing with decreasing porosity. An electrical resistivity probe appears to be a promising method of hydrate detection in ocean sediments where the hydrate layer may be represented by a resistive layer in a conductive earth. Based on the studies conducted the resolution of the resistivity and thickness is very satisfactory. Hydrate formation in sediments was modelled by a moving heat source and the change of sediment temperatures due to hydrate formation was calculated based on the rate of hydrate formation and the thermal properties of the sediments. The results indicate that local changes of the geothermal gradient in conjunction with other measurements may be used to detect hydrates.","Ph.

Firm size varies from 50,000 to 1,300,000 square feet of greenhouse space with 87% of the space being allocated to finishing the plants. The primary market is to price-oriented chain store accounts within the state of Texas. The primary competition is from Florida growers. The managers of the firms feel that an oversupply of plants in the market place will be a major factor limiting the success of their business over the next five years. The large size firms have an annual total cost per square foot of production space of $2.22. Cost of goods sold accounts for 60% of total cost for the large firms. Labor is the largest single expense with total labor accounting for 39% of total costs for the large firms. An operations process chart was used to identify potting labor and harvest labor as two parts of the production process which hold potential for variability. Potting labor varies between container sizes, plant species and the form of the plant material being potted. Potting labor for the large firms was estimated to be 22% of production labor and 6.6% of total costs. Harvest labor varies between container sizes, plant species, and the type of box used to ship the plants. The cost of harvest labor for the large firms was estimated to be 29.1% of production labor and 7.8% of total costs. The combined cost to pot and harvest the plants as estimated for the large firms was 51.1% of production labor and 14.4% of total costs. The variations between species documented in the potting labor and harvest labor studies are to a substantial degree different from the variation in labor allocation accounted for on the basis of the production space being occupied by a particular plant. Any uniform allocation of production labor costs may introduce substantial error into the estimate of the cost of producing the plant.","Ph.

Guided by an approach originally proposed by Weinberg, we construct from group theoretical arguments the (j, 0) [circle plus] (0,j) covariant spinors and the field operators for a massive particles. Specific examples are worked out in the familiar language of the Bjorken and Drell text for the case of the (1,0) [circle plus] (0,1), (3/2,0) [circle plus] (0,3/2) and (2,0) [circle plus] (0,2) matter fields. The m [to] 0 limit of the covariant spinors is shown to have the expected structure. The algebra of the [gamma][^uv] matrices associated with the (1, 0) [circle plus] (0, 1) matter fields is presented, and the conserved current derived. The procedure readily extends to higher spins. The causality problem associated with the j [greater than or equal to] 1 wave equations is discussed in detail and a systematic procedure to construct causal propagators is provided. As an example a spin two wave equation satisfied by the (2, 0) [circle plus] (0, 2), covariant spinors is found to support not only ten correct and causal solutions, but also thirty physically unacceptable acausal solutions. However, we demonstrate how to construct the Feynman propagator for the higher spin particles directly from the spinors and thus avoid the shortcomings of the wave equation in building a phenomenology. The same exercise is repeated for the (1,0) [circle plus] (0,1) and (3/2,0) [circle plus] (0,3/2) matter fields, and the same conclusions obtained. A well-known set of linear equations for massless free particles of arbitrary spin is found to have acausal solutions. On the other hand, the m [to] 0 limit of the wave equations satisfied by ( j ,0) [circle plus] (0, j ) covariant spinors are free from all kinematical acausality. This paradoxical situation is resolved and corrected through the introduction of a constraining principle. The appendix reviews and presents in a unified framework classic works of Schwinger, Weinberg and Wigner regarding the elements of canonical quantum field theory, thus establishing the logical context of our work.","Ph.

Within each of two groups of manure droppings, one protected and the other fully exposed to competitors and predators, eggs were seeded at densities of 50, 200, and 800 eggs per dropping. The percentage of eggs that produced adults was determined for each dripping within each group. Temperature and moisture conditions during development from egg to adult were monitored. Interspecific competition significantly reduced survival of the immature stages of the horn fly. Average survival during the horn fly season (March-October) in protected droppings was approximately 14 percent; whereas, survival in droppings fully exposed to competition and predation was reduced to approximately 2.8 percent.

As with any process improvement effort, managers attempting to use JIT based processes are faced with the dilemma of how to allocate fixed resources among competing projects. The resource allocation process is complicated by the present deficiencies of standard accounting practices associated with managerial accounting. Many of these deficiencies are overcome through the use of a managerial project selection, justification and evaluation methodology based on a hybrid decision model that uses organizational goals and engineering economics.

To accommodate this need, the disciplines of architectural design, urban planning, and land development were integrated to create an inclusive definition of land development. A definition that describes a successful strategy as one that is environmentally possible, ethnologically adoptable, and economically gainful. Using this definition as a foundation for comparison, a single land development project was used as the analytical point of departure for three distinct design/planning Studios. Each Studio extensively evaluated the proposal by identifying the relationships between process and form. The products from each Studio were analyzed to determine their contributions within the defined context of a successful strategy. These contributions were then incorporated into a comprehensive paradigm representing a greater sensitivity toward environmental and ethnological issues, while at the same time, recognizing the necessity for economic success.","Ph.

There seems to be a lack of emphasis on the complex nature of the process and on potential problems that can abound when the researcher reaches the stage of negotiating entry. This research presents a basis for identifying organizations and gatekeepers that would tend to be most and least likely to grant access to researchers wanting to do a naturalistic study. The theoretical basis for identifying the organizations and gatekeepers is found in P. M. Blau's theory of social exchange. The theory asserts that, in the exchange relationship, each actor's actions are dependent on those of the other actor. The actions are oriented towards ends that can only be achieved through interaction with the other person. When exchanges are reciprocated, social bonding and further exchanges result. The reciprocity moves the actors toward power balance. Unreciprocated exchanges give rise to differentiation, which creates power imbalances. The study unfolded in two phases. In Phase I, a research project was designed to study the power associations of addicts in bureaucratic organizations. When attempts to gain access for the purpose of conducting naturalistic research failed, a second research project (Phase II) was initiated. Phase II followed the naturalistic paradigm. The case studies from the failed attempts were developed to provide thick descriptive data. Then, the literature on gaining access was reviewed in an attempt to explain the phenomenon that occurred in Phase I. The findings that emerged from the research indicated that gaining entry to an organization may be facilitated by understanding the needed exchanges or reciprocal negotiations involved. Too often, in trying to do rigorous research, the researcher attempts to maintain control in the same way the organization designs its structure to maintain control. In so doing cooperation is sidestepped and the process of gaining entry becomes a win/lose battle to gain control, with the researcher, at least sometimes, being the loser.","Ph.

Horses were placed in wood metabolism stalls during the last four d of each experimental period for total fecal and urine collections. Copper absorption did not change as zinc intake increased, ranging from 42.2% to 50.7% of intake. Two experiments were conducted to quantify mineral losses in exercising horses. In the first experiment, four Miniature Horses were fed diets consisting of oats and Bermudagrass hay. During the first experimental period, horses were maintained at rest and were placed in wooden metabolism stalls for total collections during the last four d. During the second period, horses were galloped 6.1 km daily. Horses were again maintained in metabolism stalls during the last four d for total collections. Sweat loss was quantified and samples were collected. As intake increased with exercise, fecal excretion of minerals increased, and urinary excretion of sodium, calcium, potassium and chloride decreased, possibly to compensate for minerals lost in sweat. Dietary calcium and phosphorus was adequate to meet the needs of exercising horses, but sodium, potassium and chloride supplementation was indicated. In the next experiment, eight Thoroughbred horses were used in a replicated 4X4 Latin square experiment to verify previous results and to examine effects of feeding a fat-supplemented diet on electrolyte balance. Rations contained electrolyte concentrations as indicated from the previous study. Horses were exercised at two workloads to increase energy requirements approximately 150% and 200%. During the last 4 d of each period, horses were housed in metabolism crates for total collections. Sweat loss was quantified and samples were collected. There were no demonstrated effects on electrolyte balance in horses consuming a fat-supplemented versus a conventional ration. Horses were in near electrolyte balance when fed the concentrations of electrolytes as determined in the previous study.

Indian River male broiler chicks were used for all experiments. In experiment 1, a 4 x 4 factorial design was utilized consisting of 4 levels of dietary protein (16, 20, 24 and 28%) and 4 levels of dietary energy (2970, 3120, 3265 and 3410 kcal ME/kg). These diets were replicated twice and fed to 40 birds/pen for 21 days. The quadratic growth function best describing growth during the starter phase was: BW = 38.28013 + .62604*P + .172768 *E - .009532*P^2 - . 000047201*E^2 + .001238*P*E, where BW = grams body weight; P = grams cumulative protein consumption; and E = Kcal cumulative energy consumption. In experiment 2, three economical starter diets selected from experiment 1 were fed for 21 days after which nine diets in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement (16, 20 and 24% protein and 3120, 3265 and 3410 kcal ME/kg) were fed for another 21 days. The grower diets were thus replicated 3 times.

This quadratic growth function was not suitable for use in a least cost quadratic programming model because of the positive coefficient describing the quadratic effects of cumulative calorie intake. In experiment 3, nine pens were allocated to each of three economical starter and grower diets selected from the previous two experiments. These diets were fed for 42 days after which finisher diets consisting of 16, 20 and 24% protein and 3120, 3265 and 3410 kcal ME/kg were fed for another 14 days in a 3 x 3 factorial design.

These sediment movements produce forces on ocean structures, such as offshore platforms and marine pipelines, which are sufficient to fail the structures. Previous research had shown that the sediments exhibited viscoelastic characteristics in which the shear modulus could be expressed as a power law in time. This implies that the drag forces produced by sediments moving past marine structures will be a function of the relative velocity of movement between the sediment and the structure. Tests were performed to determine the drag forces produced by moving sediment on deep, shallow and partially buried model pipelines. The results were expressed in terms of generalized force coefficients, g[subscript i] which are independent of the sediment velocity, sediment shear strength and pipe dimensions. Two ""drag"" boxes were utilized to study various effects such as the sediment flow angle, total pressure, sediment shear strength and pipe surface roughness on the generalized force coefficients. Results showed that the drag forces normal to the pipe increased with depth of burial, as might be expected, until a burial depth of six to seven times the pipe diameter was reached, at which point the drag forces became constant. Axial drag forces were much smaller than the normal drag forces and reached a constant value when burial depths exceeded twice the pipe diameter. Other findings were that increases in total pressure produced increases in normal forces at burial depths greater than two pipe diameters, whereas axial forces were not affected. For burial depths less than one pipe diameter, increases of external pressure produced smaller axial and normal forces depending on the amount and duration of the pressure. At shallow burial depths, freely rotated pipes produced no surface roughness effect at failure points; however, clamped pipes exhibited somewhat higher normal forces for roughened surfaces. At large displacements, after pipe-sediment separation, roughness effects were minor. Results of the drag tests on pipes are compared with existing theoretical predictions for various cases of separation at the interface between the pipe and the sediment. The theoretical predictions for no separation compared closely with the experimental results for deeply buried pipes under the highest total pressures. Other theoretical cases of separation compared closely with actual results for shallow and partially buried pipe.","Ph.

Specifically, this investigation seeks to determine how personal involvement, defined here in terms of Crano's (in press) model of vested interest, affects message processing under different conditions of personal relevance, defined here as perceived risk of misfortune. It is suggested that personal relevance and personal involvement may interact and produce unique affects on message processing. In this investigation, participants were randomly assigned to read either a strong or weak message regarding the chosen misfortune and to complete a variety of questionnaires assessing their attitudes toward the topic. Under conditions of high levels of personal relevance, high personal involvement subjects proved more susceptible to a weak message than low personal involvement individuals. Specifically, high risk/high vested interest people appeared to be engaged in danger control processing because they were willing to accept a message that advocated prevention of a misfortune (i.e., an adaptive response to a threat) , even though the basis of the arguments were weak and specious. High risk/low vested interest individuals, on the other hand, appeared to be engaged in fear control processing because they were not willing to accept a weak and specious message that advocated prevention of a misfortune (i.e., a defensive response to deny a threat). The danger and fear control processing found in the high personal relevance condition was not evident among low personal relevance individuals who received weak messages. That is, people of low risk/high vested interest did not scrutinize a weak message more than low risk/low vested interest subjects. This suggests that the lower personal relevance of the low risk condition attenuates the effects of personal involvement (i.e., vested interest). These results suggest that only under conditions of high personal relevance does personal involvement (i.e., vested interest) influence message processing.","Ph.

The existence of the solution is proven by using the successive approximation technique. The theory considers both finite dimensional and infinite dimensional systems. By using the trace operator of the product of two Hilbert-Schmidt operators, all the matrix theory in the finite dimensional minimax control theory can be extended to distributed parameter systems. A finite dimensional approximation scheme also is developed. It is proven that the minimax solution of the infinite dimensional problem can exactly be specified by a convergent sequence of minimax solutions of finite dimensional approximations of the problem. Examples that provide verification of the theory presented in this dissertation include (1) scalar minimax controller design, (2) finite dimensional output feedback minimax robust controller design, and (3) minimax controller design of a parabolic heat problem by spline approximation. The contribution of the dissertation is (1) to broaden the application of minimax control theory and make it a straightforward engineering tool for robust controller design by using eigenvalue sensitivity approach and (2) to show the feasibility of finite dimensional approximation of the worst case distributed parameter system robust control.","Ph.

Although these reservoirs have been penetrated with numerous wellbores (for developing deeper horizons), they have not been commercially productive with conventional vertical wells.  These reservoirs can be characterized as two thin, low permeability layers with no crossflow between them. Productivity of these reservoirs is reduced by gas blocking behavior when attempting to produce below the bubble point pressure. The objective of this work was to investigate the viability of converting existing conventional vertical wells to horizontal wells with multiple transverse fractures. These fractures will not only significantly increase the productivity, but also provide the vertical communication needed between the reservoir layers. Reservoir simulation was used to evaluate various combinations of transverse fractures in horizontal wells.  These results were compared with simulation results for conventional vertical wells, with and without vertical fractures.  Only infinite conductivity fractures were considered.  Early transient behavior as well as pseudosteadystate behavior were simulated.  An economical analysis was made for the horizontal wells with multiple transverse fractures. The results show that horizontal wells with transverse fractures appear to make production of the Upper Baharlyla reservoirs economically feasible. In this work, the productivity index has been presented for horizontal wells with various combinations of transverse fractures, producing from the Upper Bahariyia reservoirs.  It has been shown that the productivity index of horizontal wells with transverse fractures is mainly affected by the distance between the outermost fractures and not by the number of fractures nor the spacing between them.  Between fractures perforations has been shown to have negligible effects on increasing the productivity of horizontal wells with transverse fractures in this reservoir.  Also decline type curves are presented, for vertical fractured and horizontal with transverse fractures wells, for future performance prediction and reserves estimates. Although the conclusions of this work were targeted to provide guidelines for selecting a feasible producing technique for the targeted reservoir, these conclusions can be used in similar multiple layered oil reservoirs.","Ph.

A time domain harmonic scaling algorithm (TDHS) is used to compress input speech by a factor of two. This process allows the tree coder to have 2 bits/sample for 6.4 kbps and 1.5 bits/sample for 4.8 kbps in the case of a 6.4 kHz sampling rate. Various window functions and pitch extraction algorithms are compared in the TDHS algorithm. In the backward adaptive tree coder, there are three components of the code generator, including a hybrid adaptive quantizer, a short-term predictor and a pitch predictor. The short-term predictor with a pole-zero structure improves the performance of the tree coder in the error free channel over an all-pole structure. The robustness of the tree coder is achieved by carefully choosing the input of the short-term predictor adaptation. The residual signal shaped by an all-zero filter is used as the input for adaptation. The all-zero filter is obtained by truncating the infinite impulse response of the pole-zero synthesis filter. Another method to improve the robustness of the tree coder is the inclusion of a smoother in the pitch predictor. The coefficients of the smoother with three taps are computed from the estimated autocorrelation function of the pitch synthesizer output. The inclusion of a smoother provides a small improvement in the error free channel and robustness to transmission errors. Subjectively, tree coding combined with TDHS achieves very good quality speech at the rate of 6.4 kbps and good quality speech at 4.8 kbps. The performance of the coding system is evaluated for real speech by means of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), segmental SNR, frequency domain SNR, spectrograms, and informal listening tests.","Ph.

Flaws in previous methods include: 1) the inability to completely remove solvent from recovered asphalt, 2) the inability to completely extract asphalt from the aggregate, and 3) a tendency to alter asphalt properties during extraction. The new methods improve precision and accuracy by minimizing these errors. The new procedures also conserve solvent and require less operator effort. As specified, the standard ASTM solvent removal procedure is not capable of removing all of the extraction solvent from extracted asphalts. Analysis of residual solvent by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) made it possible to determine optimal conditions for solvent recovery such as oil bath temperature, nitrogen flow, vacuum, and recovery time. Both the Abson and Roto-vap methods were studied. Neither provided consistent solvent removal for varying grades of asphalts. After raising recovery temperatures and extending recovery times, both methods were capable of removing all solvent from asphalts having 60°C viscosities of 200,000 poise. During extraction, asphalts are dissolved in strong solvents for several hours. ASTM D-2172B subjects asphalts to dilute solutions of trichloroethylene (TCE) at 80°C for several hours. Exposure to solvents causes hardening and softening of asphalts depending on the concentration and temperature. Solution conditions which result in minimal hardening or softening were determined. The new methods were designed such that asphalts are not exposed to hash solution conditions. Previous methods left up to 10% of the asphalt on the aggregate. This was due to poor mixing and the use of weak solvents. Several solvents were studied for their ability to extract strongly adsorbed material from aggregate fines. TCE with 15% ethanol (TCE/EtOH) and toluene with 15% ethanol (Tol/EtOH) showed good extractibility and were chosen as the extraction solvents for the new methods.

The traits simulated were birth weight, yearling weight, mature weight and milk production. In the original model genetic potentials were specified by growth rate, mature weight and milk production. The progeny inherited these traits from the dam with no contribution from the sire. The model was modified so that the progeny inherited attributes from both the sire and the dam. The incorporation of genetics into the model allowed for the introduction of variation among individuals and from generation to generation. This was achieved by interfacing the original model with stochastic genetic subroutines. The variation introduced in the simulated populations was used to examine different selection scenarios. Application of restricted selection index for desired genetic change, developed by Yamada et al. (1975), was examined. The index included birth weight and yearling weight. Correlated gains in mature weight and milk production were also studied. This allowed for comparison of different selection objectives in different genotypes. Five within herd selection experiments were carried out to illustrate the model. Selection index methods using birth weight and yearling weight resulted in more gain in all traits compared to single trait selection on yearling weight. During selection for birth weight and yearling weight dystocia patterns were also examined. Dystocia patterns in the small moderate-sized breed were similar to those in the large breed when mature size was increased. In the small to moderate-sized breed selection on yearling weight alone resulted in the low dystocia levels while selection for reduced birth weight in the large breed actually reduced dystocia levels. Analysis of selection response for birth weight and yearling weight over twenty years of simulation using simple linear regression yielded results that were in general agreement with expected gains computed a priori.","Ph.

Microhabitat location was influenced by visual cues from the host plant. Parasitoids located a cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum L.) more readily than a single cotton leaf. Damaged cotton plants provided chemical cues and neither experienced nor naive parasitoids flew to undamaged plants. Experienced females completed equal numbers of flights to mechanically damaged leaves and to naturally damaged leaves either with host frass and Heliothis virescens (F.) larvae (host/plant complex) or without host larvae. Naive parasitoids completed fewer flights than experienced females but exhibited the same specificity. Parasitization experience consisted of oviposition in hosts and exposure to damaged plants and to host frass. Oviposition caused experienced females to complete more flights than naive females and was as effective in stimulating flight as contact with all three factors. Females contacting frass or damaged plants, without oviposition, completed fewer flights than naive females with no contact with kairomones. Cotton seedlings released green leaf chemicals and terpenes. Headspace collections from damaged and undamaged plants were different and may account for the increased attractiveness of damaged plants to C. sonorensis. Undamaged plants produced small amounts of volatiles compared to damaged plants but no new chemicals were detected after damage. Parasitoids reared on hosts fed plant material were no more responsive to host/plant complex odors than were parasitoids reared from hosts fed artificial diet. The diet of the host did not affect the parasitoid's microhabitat preference. Parasitoids given oviposition experience 1 min prior to bioassay completed more flights than did naïve females to two host plants, cotton and sesame (Sesamum indicum L.), and to a nonhost plant, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). However, after 24 h, only females experienced on potato responded at levels significantly higher than naive females indicating that females learned the novel odor of the nonhost.

The population was fourth grade teachers in the State of Texas employed during that time. The sample was all fourth grade teachers at 300 schools selected at random. Descriptive statistics were used to report personal and professional characteristics of the teachers as well as their tendencies to teach agriculture, use of concepts related to agriculture in their teaching, and their preference in assistance programs to help them teach about agriculture. Frequencies and percentages were computed and used to develop a profile of the teachers. Correlational techniques were used to determine and measure relationships between and among personal and professional characteristics of the teachers as well as their tendencies to teach agriculture, use concepts related to agriculture in their teaching, and their preference in assistance programs to help them teach about agriculture. Comparative techniques were used to detect differences between teachers based upon their personal and professional characteristics. The major findings of the study were as follows: (1) Fourth grade teachers had few background characteristics that involved agriculture. (2) Teachers had an unacceptably low knowledge about agriculture. (3) Almost all fourth grade teachers perceived agriculture to be farming and ranching only. (4) Most teachers taught about agriculture or used agricultural concepts in teaching.

Mother/infant relationships have been most extensively explored from the standpoint of the mother. This study investigated mother/infant and peer bonds formed by Nubian goat kids in the first three months of life. The hypothesis was that the mother/infant bond was stronger than the sibling/sibling bond. An open-field test (n = 22) and a two-choice selection chamber test (n = 30) were used. Each individual was presented both tests, repeated in each of four age classes: (1) 1-3 wks, (2) 4-6 wks, (3) 7-9 wks and (4) 10-12 wks. Preference in the open-field test was determined by proximity during four activities: resting, nursing, grazing and moving. Preferences in the selection chamber were determined by choice in six replicate trials of each choice pair: dam vs. sibling, dam vs. strange kid, strange doe vs. sibling and herdmate kid vs. strange kid. In the open-field test, preference for proximity of sibling was dependent on activity. Resting and nursing always occurred with the sibling. The sibling was preferred during grazing in age class 1 (T = -2.29, P = 0.03) and in age class 4 (T = -3.11, P = 0.005). Grazing was either near a sibling or a herdmate kid. Siblings were not preferred during moving activities. In the chamber test, kids approached either the dam or sibling significantly more frequently than the strange kid or doe. The sibling bond superceded the mother/infant bond in age classes 2 and 3. Preference for herdmate kid over strange kid increased with age. The hypothesis that the mother/infant bond is stronger than the sibling bond was rejected. The mother/infant bond is strong, but is superceded by the sibling bond most of the time. Age-related changes in the mother/infant bond may be related to changes in the ability of the mother to provide milk and in maturing social relationships of the kid.

The finite difference approach normally used to approximate spatial derivatives in extrapolating angular fluxes across a cell is replaced by direct solution of the characteristic form of the transport equation for each discrete direction. Thus, computational cells are not restricted to the traditional shape of a mesh element within a given coordinate system. However, in terms of the treatment of energy and angular dependencies, this method resembles traditional discrete ordinates techniques. Using the method developed here, a general two-dimensional space can be approximated by an irregular mesh comprised of arbitrary polygons. The method of characteristics, originally developed to eliminate negative fluxes encountered in many finite difference approximations, had been previously applied to regular cell structures in multiple dimensions and various coordinate systems. In such geometries, the geometrical relationships between sides were determined analytically and incorporated directly into the numerical model. However, the present work makes no assumptions about the orientations or the number of sides in a given cell, and computes all geometric relationships between each set of sides in each cell for each discrete direction. A set of non-reentrant polygons can therefore be used to represent any given two dimensional space. Results for a number of test problems have been compared to solutions obtained from traditional methods, with good agreement. Comparisons include benchmarks against analytical results for problems with simple geometry, as well numerical results obtained from traditional discrete ordinates methods by applying the ANISN and TWOTRAN computer programs. Numerical results were obtained for problems ranging from simple one-dimensional geometry to complicated multidimensional configurations. These results have demonstrated the ability of the developed method to closely approximate complex geometrical configurations and to obtain accurate results for problems that are extremely difficult to model using traditional methods.","Ph.

Data on Model Foods was used to determine effect of composition and density on thermal conductivity of foods and to develop thermal conductivity prediction models. Three sets of 'real' food data were used for testing the performance and validity of the proposed models. Variation in the composition and densities were examined over the following ranges: water content, 0% to 80%; protein content, 0% to 30%; carbohydrate content, 0% to 60%; fat content, 0% to 100%; and density, 0.849 g/cm^2 to 1.189 g/cm^2. Effects of water content, fat content and density on thermal conductivity of Model Foods were found to be highly significant (PR > F = 0.0001) while effects of protein and carbohydrate contents were non-significant (PR > F = 0.7543 and PR > F = 0.7445, respectively). Linear models of thermal conductivity as a function of composition and density inadequately explain thermal conductivity of Model Foods. Two relatively simple quadratic models, Model 5 and Model 6, were developed. Model 5 expresses thermal conductivity as a function of water content, water content squared, and density. Model 6 contains all terms in Model 5 and includes the first and second order terms of fat content. Both models did equally well in predicting thermal conductivity of 'real' foods. However, Model 6 did better for high fat content foods. The performance of both models in prediction of thermal conductivity of 'real' foods is comparable to their performance with the Model Foods. Both proposed models were compared with two literature models which express thermal conductivity as a function of composition. The proposed model did equally well or better in predicting thermal conductivity of 'real' foods. The presence of density terms in Model 5 and Model 6 enables the models to predict thermal conductivity of unusually high or low density foods with smaller errors than that of literature models.","Ph.

From this library, two groups of clones for the major tuber protein, patatin, were isolated. The complete sequence of two of these clones, pGM01 and pGM203, was determined. They are 98% homologous and correspond to the two major species of patatin identified by amino-terminal polypeptide sequence analysis. Both encode proteins of 363 amino acids with an additional 23 amino acid signal sequence. Patatin mRNA is approximately 1550 nucleotides in length and is present in large amounts in tubers, in trace amounts in roots, but is not present in leaves or stems. Potato DNA was used to construct genomic libraries from which 30 patatin genomic clones were isolated. All of these exhibited different restriction patterns, but could be divided into two classes based on the presence (Class II) or absence (Class I) of a 22 bp sequence within the 5'untranslated region. The complete DNA sequence of the Class I clone, PS20, the Class II clones SA10C and SB6B, and the 5' flanking sequence of seven additional clones was determined. The transcribed region of PS20 spans 3197 bp and is divided by six introns. The seven exons encode a transcript which is identical to the cDNA, pGM203. SB6B and SA10C both are pseudogenes which contain frameshift mutations. The 5' flanking sequences of both Class I and II patatin genes are highly homologous to position -87 and then diverge. This conserved region contains the CAAT and TATA homologies as well as a homology to the core enhancer sequence. Within a class there are additional large regions of homology, but differences exist that allow the patatin genes to be further divided into several discrete subclasses. S1 nuclease protection experiments with both Class I and Class II probes has shown that Class I transcripts are the predominant species present in tubers. Class II transcripts are present in tubers, but are 50-100 fold less abundant. In roots, Class II transcripts are the predominant species and there are few, if any, Class I transcripts.","Ph.

Until recently such canopies have not been recognized in nature and the distribution of shallow salt beneath the lower continental slope of the northwest Gulf of Mexico has not been known. This study is the first publicly available field confirmation of a very extensive shallow salt canopy in the Gulf of Mexico region. Approximately 6,400 kilometers of 24- and 48-fold common depth point seismic data were interpreted in the region bounded by 94-96° west longitude and 26-27° north latitude. Maps of the seafloor morphology, the structure contour of the top of the allochthonous salt canopy, and the thickness of the suprasalt sediments show that almost the entire lower slope is covered by a shallow canopy. The broad area of little relief on the western side of Alaminos Canyon in underlain by salt and is not salt-free as previously proposed. Both Alaminos and Rio Perdido Canyons are salt-free areas between lobes of the distal front of the salt sheet. The canopy on the west side of the study area is classified as a stock canopy which formed when salt was pushed upward into sediments which have a lower density than salt. Gravitational spreading into low strength sediments formed a canopy in which the stock locations are marked by highs on the top of the salt sheet and/or by bathymetric highs. The salt spread out and downslope from these local highs in a more or less radial fashion and coalesced to form a large stock canopy. The canopy on the east side of the study area is classified as a lobe canopy which formed by downslope spreading from salt stocks; several lobes coalesced into a lobe canopy. Fluid pressure calculations reveal that the salt beneath seafloor uplifts is deeply rooted (7-15 km thick). Exploration strategy would center on the location of deep salt conduits and reservoirs beneath the canopy close to the intersection of the canopy and the deep stocks.","Ph.

Toward the practical applications, we have introduced a new definition of admissible control, derived an integral version of maximum principle using dynamic programming and Sobolev space Frechet differential theory, and presented the costate equation in a general tensor notation. As special cases, we have studied the optimal control and optimal state estimation problems for quantum mechanical systems. We have studied the optimal regulation problem for a two-dimensional hyperbolic system. A general structure for the feedback control has been found. It has been shown that the linear component (in terms of system state) of the optimal feedback control is equal to the solution of the LQ problem for the linearized system. We have developed a target approximation method to facilitate a low dimension controller. This method uses a robust infinite dimensional closed-loop system as a reference, if designs a feedback controller and the actuator and sensor locations in such a way that the resulting feedback system imitates the target so that the closed-loop stability and design performance are preserved.

The reactivity of (Ph2PCH2CH2S)2Ni with organic or inorganic electrophiles was dominated by sulfur sites; for example, reaction with CH3I and BrCH2CH2CH2Br afford cationic thioethers, reaction with SO2 resulted in the formation of an SO2 adduct, and reaction with (NBD)Mo(CO)4 yielded the bimetallic NiP2S2Mo(CO)4. Nickel thioether complexes, [Ni(PSEt)2][BF4]2 and [Ni(PSSP)][BF4]2, showed two reduction waves ascribed to Ni[^II/I] and Ni[^1/0]. Ni^0 species can be prepared by chemical reduction with Na/Hg, which provided synthetic route to the desired organometallic complexes of the type [Ni(PSR)2L]+ with L = H, CH3, COCH3 . Acetyl products were produced either from oxidative addition of CH3COCI to Ni^0 or by CO insertion into Ni-CH3 at low temperature. The reversible CO insertion has been found in the reaction of CO with Ni-CH3 derivatives. The reaction of (Ph2PCH2CH2S)2Ni with Fe2(CO)9 at 70 °C resulted in ligand transfer and the isolation of an Fe2S2 complex which was characterized by x-ray crystallography. This complex displayed reactivity toward acid and afforded iron products with both terminal and bridged hydrides.

The ten components descriptive of family environment were cohesion, expressiveness, conflict, independence, achievement orientation, intellectual-cultural orientation, active-recreational orientation, moral religious emphasis, organization, and control. Parenting style variables evident in the home were classified as authoritarian, authoritative, or permissive. School outcome variables measured were grade point average, absences, conflicts with authority, and achievement. The subjects for the study were 207 adolescents from grades 9 through 12, randomly selected from a high school population of 1300. Subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire dealing with their situation at home and at school as it currently existed. The survey called for responses to demographic information, to a set of questions used to classify the style of parenting used in their home, and to the Family Environment Scale which is a measure of quality of family of origin environment. The results of the study supported the existence of a concomitant relationship between family environment and school outcome variables. Grade point average was significantly related to independence, achievement orientation, and intellectual-cultural orientation; attendance was significantly related to achievement orientation; and conflict at school was significantly related to the lack of moral-religious emphasis. With regard to predicting grade point average, achievement orientation in the home was most predictive of the ten environmental components. However, the ability of family environmental factors to predict attendance pattern, school conflict, or academic achievement was not shown to be significant. Finally, in terms of the ability of parenting style to predict school outcomes, authoritarian parenting was shown to be predictive of grade point average; authoritative and permissive parenting styles were shown to be predictive of attendance patterns; but, none of the parenting styles were shown to be significant predictors of either conflicts with authority or achievement.","Ph.

This air sampling technique utilized carbon molecular sieve contained in a stainless steel tube for the collection of methanol vapor from controlled test atmospheres. The test atmospheres were generated by means of a dynamic, all-glass system which utilized a syringe drive to introduce methanol into an air stream of known temperature and humidity. The sampling period for all samples was 120 minutes. The test atmosphere was drawn through the tube by means of a battery-powered air sampling pump which could be fitted with various flow-limiting orifices. In preliminary studies at test conditions of 95% RH at 35° C, and 400 ppm methanol, a sampling flow rate of 20 mL/min (established by means of limiting orifices) was the maximum flow which did not produce more than 5% breakthrough; this sampling flow rate was used in all subsequent parts of the research. The collection tubes were desorbed with 250° C nitrogen in a programmed thermal desorber, and the amount of desorbed methanol vapor was determined through gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. The analytical instrumentation was calibrated by direct injection of methanol into the inlet of the programmed thermal desorber. Next studies were conducted to assess the performance of the technique under conditions of varying temperature, humidity, and methanol concentration. These investigations demonstrated that the methanol concentration, partial pressure of water vapor, and the interaction of temperature with partial pressure of water vapor had a significant effect upon the recovery, while breakthrough was significantly affected by the partial pressure of water vapor and the interaction of temperature with the partial pressure of water vapor. In general, the data suggest that the sampling flow rate should be increased to 50-100 mL/min if the anticipated methanol concentration is less than 50 ppm and that breakthrough occurred only under conditions of high heat and humidity when the methanol concentration was 800 ppm...","Ph.

Somatic embryogenesis is important because it is essential for the regeneration of intact plants from transgenic cell. Somatic embryogenesis has been suspected for some time to be genotype dependant, but the mode of inheritance and the number of genes affecting the trait were unknown. In this research, crosses were made between four cotton genotypes; Coker 312, and TM-1, 'Stoneville 506' or 'Acala SJ-2'. Parents and their progenies were tested in tissue culture for somatic embryogenic potential. A complete randomized block design was used for tissue culture research, and calli were initiated from hypocotyl tissue of three to five day old seedlings. Globular embryos were present in calli after six weeks in culture, but many embryos could not be differentiated at that time. The embryos were transferred to culture flasks with liquid media until four weeks later, at which time they were scored. There was no evidence of maternal effects on somatic embryogenesis. Chi-square tests were used to test ratios corresponding to possible genetic systems for the embryogenic trait. Embryogenesis in Coker 312 was found to be controlled by one dominant gene. The expression of that dominant gene for embryogenesis is blocked by two or three dominant genes at separate loci in TM-1, Stoneville 506, and Acala SJ-2. Breeding for embryogenic potential in cotton is feasible, and would be best accomplished by a cycle of repeated backcrossing, selfing, and selection with Coker 312 as the donor parent. Large populations would be needed in the backcross generations of such a selection program because of the low frequency of embryogenic plants resulting from backcrossing.","Ph.

Resistant horn flies were less fit than susceptible flies. Pyrethroid-resistance was a reproductive disadvantage under insecticide free conditions. This disadvantage may be integrated into a horn fly control program. A field technique was developed to monitor insecticide-resistance in horn flies. The technique quickly and successfully determined the amount of resistance present in various populations by using discriminating doses of insecticides. This technique is easier to use and simpler to prepare than current techniques. In vitro saxitoxin (STX) binding to proteins from the heads of susceptible and target-site insensitive house flies, Musca domestica L., and horn flies was measured. STX bound to a single type of high affinity site in house fly heads that had not been exposed to any insecticides. STX binding to horn fly heads was low and difficult to measure, but appeared to occur similarly to the mechanism in house flies. In vivo insecticide exposure rapidly (15 minutes) reduced STX binding to house fly heads and indicated that binding sites were associated with either two types of sodium channels, or two types of regulation, or both. Exposure to permethrin reduced binding to one type of site more than to the other. Exposure to cypermethrin or diazinon reduced binding to both sites equally. This work is the first report on the effects of in vivo insecticide exposure on STX binding to sodium channels in an insect. Susceptible and resistant house flies had similar amounts of sodium channel protein. In resistant flies, the ratio of the two types of binding sites differed from that of susceptible files. Only resistant flies showed behavioral and biochemical signs of recovery from intoxication by pyrethroids. Lipid extractions from heads of susceptible and target-site insensitive house flies indicated that both strains had similar amounts of lipids. Pyrethroid exposure, did not alter the turnover of lipids. Target-site insensitivity appears to result from an innate, regulatory response which reduces the number of functional sodium channels present after intoxication and is only effective against poisons that interact with sodium channels.","Ph.

The error component model is the most popular specification in panel data econometrics. With panel data, we can answer more complex questions than would be possible by using time-series data or cross-sectional data alone. However, panel data also introduce difficulties. For the one-way error component model, if the error term is serially correlated, then the estimation methods were quite complicated. This dissertation proposes a simple transformation that circumvents the problem of serial correlation in an error component model. This not only simplifies the calculation, but also gives natural estimators of the variance components. Moreover, we generalize Breusch's (1987) maximum likelihood estimation method to the serial correlation case. Which can be used to guard against possible local maxima. We also derive the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) for the error component model with an arbitrary serially correlated remainder term. We show that once one knows the BLUP for the time series model with serially correlated errors, using our method, one can immediately write out the corresponding BLUP for error component model with the same type of serial correlation in the remainder term. Thus our approach makes the panel data literature parallel to that of time series literature and therefore should prove very useful in applications. The chapter of testing serial correlation gives several Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests for testing first-order serial correlation. Our Monte Carlo results show that these tests perform well in detecting serial correlation in an error component model. We also show that the LM test cannot distinguish a first order autocorrelation (AR(1)) process from a first order moving average (MA(1)) process. Thus we further derive several tests for testing AR(1) against MA(1) in an error component model. Another problem with the error component model is that the commonly used test statistic for testing zero variance component is the two-sided Breusch-Pagan test. However, since the variance component never takes negative values, the proper test statistic should be one-sided. Although Honda (1985) and King and Wu (1990) derived some one-sided test statistics for the error component model. We show that these tests have some drawbacks, we further derive some new tests which are immune to these drawbacks. Our Monte Carlo results show that these new tests perform better than the existing tests.","Ph.

The sediment-free water released from the reservoir could induce severe problems on downstream channel erosion because the reservoir trapping sediment load disturbs the natural balance between sediment supply and sediment transport. To satisfy its transport capacity, the flow scours the channel and picks up sediment load. The reservoir-induced erosion superimposes on the natural erosion process and will continue until a new equilibrium is reached. The erosion rate induced by an upstream reservoir is estimated by an erosion-rate model proposed in this study. The parameters in this model are defined by algebraic relations in terms of channel characteristics. These relations are derived from regression analyses based on the data published by Williams and Wolman (1984). These empirical relations can be used to determine the unknown parameters for a given stream by input of the channel slope, flow discharge and velocity. The validity of the proposed model is tested by the published field data, and the stream bank erosion of a meander bend in a natural state is estimated by using Odgaard's (1987) Equation, which expresses bank erosion in terms of channel characteristics. Bank erosion below a reservoir is the result of natural erosion and reservoir-induced erosion. The computation of estimation is facilitated by a computer program. EROS.FOR. which is written in FORTRAN. This method is illustrated by examples of the Colorado River and Brazos River, both in Texas. Com paring the estimated data with the observed data on these rivers shows that the method provides reasonable and acceptable estimates for bank erosion of alluvial channels below reservoirs.

However, a major drawback of such systems is that a single processor failure may destroy the whole network.  As the probability of any one or more processors failing in such a complex system is great, building some fault-tolerance feature into them becomes extremely important.  In this dissertation, a new effective approach is proposed for achieving fault tolerance in hypercubes.  This approach will enable the hypercube to continue working in case of failure in a short time. In particular, three algorithms are presented for reconfiguring faulty hypercubes using spanning trees to achieve communication between the unfaulty processors.  The first algorithm uses the completely unbalanced spanning tree (CUST), the second one uses the balanced spanning tree (BST), and the third algorithm is based on using general spanning trees (GST) for reconfiguring the hypercube to avoid faulty nodes.  The parallel algorithm developed for reconfiguring faulty hypercubes using GST can be generalized to work for reconfiguring multicomputer networks in general in the presence of faults.  These algorithms use, at most, one used link and one unused link for every reconstructed path in the reconfigured hypercube.  These reconstruction algorithms can reconfigure around any single fault in 0(l) reconfiguration time with no extra-dilation and will increase the congestion of a link by, at most, one.  The algorithms are optimal, in terms of the reconfiguration time, and can be used for reconfiguration of spanning trees, which have been used extensively for communications and broadcasting, in a hypercube in the presence of node failures. Simulation results for the algorithms under multiple faults also are presented.  Results show that the algorithms provide close to 100% fault coverage of double and triple faults for hypercubes having a dimension of 10 or more.  Fault coverage and congestion results for up to 60 faults having different cube sizes are presented.  We also evaluate the improvement of reliability in hypercubes based on these reconfiguration algorithms.  With these algorithms, the system's recovery is shown to be faster, improving hypercube reliability.  A dependability evaluation study, based on a Markov chain model for a cluster of four hypercube nodes, is presented.","Ph. D","Doctorial","","Major computer science","","","","","","","34932139",""

First, non-normality (in general) leads to overestimation of consumer surplus when using either observed or predicted demand. Second, heteroscedasticity leads to 20% overestimation of consumer surplus when using predicted demand, but only leads to 3% overestimation when using observed demand. The overall implication of these results stresses the importance of testing for model misspecification when using the Tobit model to estimate consumer surplus. If misspecification is present, researchers need to correct for it in order to arrive at accurate and reliable consumer surplus estimates. Otherwise, the use of a semiparateric model is a viable alternative. Various results are also evident for the Monte Carlo experiments using semiparametric models. First, consumer surplus derived from the symmetrically trimmed least squares model tends to overestimate the simulated consumer surplus in all cases except for two sample designs. Second, consumer surplus computed from the Buckley and James model are nearly identical to the simulated consumer surplus in all cases. The overall implication of this finding supports the use of the Buckley and James model to compute consumer surplus.  Finally, results from the Monte Carlo experiments using truncated parametric and semiparametric models are very pessimistic. The results indicate that consumer surplus derived from truncated parametric and semiparametric models tend to greatly overestimate the simulated consumer surplus (i.e., by greater than 70%). The implications of this finding are that researchers either need to cease using on-site sample surveys to estimate consumer surplus, or develop alternative truncated models.","Ph.

The RFQ is designed to accelerate a 10 mA H- ion beam from 30 keV to 500 keV with the operating frequency of 473 MHz. This new type of RFQ structure not only promises simplicity of design, construction, and operation, but also can be manufactured to operate at higher frequencies than previously achieved by other four-rod type RFQs. Combination of simplicity and compactness due to higher operating frequencies (400 to 500 MHz) makes the design desirable for injector of proton accelerators, medical linear accelerators, and variety of other applications. This dissertation presents the steps I went through in inventing, developing, and experimentally testing this new RFQ design. First an introduction to accelerators is given, and the basic accelerator physics terminologies are defined. The principles of operations of the RFQs are described, and the theory behind new type of RFQ structure is explained. Then the beam dynamics and cavity design of the RFQ are presented.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that the Form 8-K which reports a change in auditors also indicate if the change is due to the resignation of the auditor. This action implies a belief by the SEC that an auditor resignation may communicate different information to the market than would the termination of an auditor by a client company. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the announcement of an auditor resignation has information content for the market. The reaction to the announcement is significantly negative on the day of the filing of the 8-K, the day following, and in the two-day window taken as a whole. Alternative explanations for the observed negative returns are explored and rejected. Results of an examination of a portfolio of companies failing to provide a reason and name a successor, and a portfolio of companies giving a reason for the auditor resignation or of giving information concerning the successor auditor reveal no significant differences between the returns of these portfolios. No difference is observed in the response of a portfolio of companies providing a reason for the resignation and a portfolio of those companies which fail to provide a reason. Tests are performed to test the sensitivity of the results to the deletion of outliers and the deletion of companies having firm-specific news announcements in the event window. It does not appear that extreme outliers or firm-specific new announcements are responsible for the negative returns exhibited in this sample of companies. The sensitivity of the results to day-of-the-week effects is tested and also rejected as a possible explanation for the negative returns observed in this sample. It appears that significant and persistent negative returns are earned by companies' shareholders when it is announced that auditors have resigned.","Ph.

Both labels were ultrastructurally co-localized in endocytic vesicles, the Golgi apparatus, multivesicular bodies (MVB), and the large central vacuole. Protoplasts were also incubated in CF and immunolabeled for glucosidase II (GSII), a glycosylation-trimming enzyme. CF and GSII were co-localized along the plasma membrane, in endocytic vesicles, the partially-coated reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and MVB. The ability of cells to sort proteins and polysaccharides to the correct destination was investigated by incubating protoplasts in monensin, an ionophore, and CF and histochemically labeling for AcPase activity. Monensin inhibited the localization of AcPase in multivesicular bodies, indicating that there may be a monensin-sensitive sorting mechanism in plants Monensin did not inhibit the internalization of CF. Lucifer yellow (LY) internalization was examined for its usefulness as a fluid-phase marker. Monensin did not inhibit by internalization.

Further analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of herd, sex of calf, dam navel score, sire sheath score, dam navel x sire sheath and adjusted weaning weight on calf sheath/navel score. The sale data was analyzed to evaluate the effects of sheath score on sale price. The effect of sires was nested within herd and herd was nested within year. The effects of herd, sire within herd and sex of calf were significant for adjusted weaning weight (P <.001). Bull calves were heavier at weaning than heifer calves. Calf sheath/navel score was significant for adjusted weaning weight (P <.05). Calves scoring three for sheath/navel were heavier than those scoring two or less, but were not different than calves scoring four or greater. The effects of herd, sex of calf, dam navel score, sire sheath score, dam navel x sire sheath interaction and adjusted weaning weight were significant for calf sheath/navel score. Bull calves had higher sheath/navel scores than heifer calves (P <.01). Calf sheath/navel score increased significantly with both dam navel score (P <.01) and sire sheath score (P <.001).

This matrix is composed of a spherulitic superstructure with a lamellar microstructure. The careful study of characterized fractions allowed the quantitative description of the melting profile of the whole copolymer, which corresponds to the crystallite size distribution. This description was achieved by the calculation of the most probable unbranched ethylene sequence, and whereby it was assumed that the lamellar thickness is directly linked to this sequence. This lamellar thickness had to be adjusted by the number average molecular weight to achieve the final distribution. Another method extrapolated the effect of branching on this sequence from a region of low branching frequency to a region of high frequency. This lamellar thickness also had to be adjusted by the number average molecular weight to achieve the final distribution. The crystallite size distribution of the fractions and the whole copolymer was changed by annealing procedures. The rate of change was accelerated by the use of cool-raise and cool-raise-cool procedures. The rate and extent of change is governed by the branch and molecular weight distribution. The total crystallinity was rather invariant for this copolymer. This was explained by segregation of low-molecular weight fractions. At very low strain, the stress relaxation was found to be dependent on the total crystallinity, but independent of the crystallite size distribution. Frequency-temperature studies indicated that the modulus may be predicted, at least up to the melting point, by the extrapolation of low temperature data and by taking into account changes in the degree of crystallinity. However, the imaginary modulus is affected more than the real modulus by the distribution change.","Ph.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in this area due to the mounting U.S. trade deficits. Economists have found that when markets are imperfectly competitive, there are certain trade policies that can benefit a country at the expense of others. The choice of policy is thus viewed as a strategic game between governments. This game is complicated by the presence of uncertainty in the market. This dissertation analyzes a government's optimal choice of trade policy under a variety of market structures and assumptions concerning the structure of costs faced by firm s. In particular, governments are shown to prefer price-type policy instruments, namely subsidies or taxes, in a highly uncertain environment, and quantity controls if demand is reasonably stable. Furthermore, this pattern of preferences is shown to hold across a variety if cost structures and assumptions regarding firm behavior.","Ph.

Finally, functional studies were performed to determine how one of the mabs was affectin(Y fertilization.  The mabs chosen for this project were generated against the human sperm antigens FA-1, SAA-1, and SP- I 0. Western blot analysis revealed that the mabs identified antigens of similar molecular weight to human FA-1, SAA- 1, and SP- I 0 in bovine spermatozoa.  Indirect  immunotluorescence, using epifluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy, demonstrated that the antigens were localized to regions of bovine sperm similar to their human homologues. The antifertilization effects of the mabs were then tested in bovine in vitro fertilization (IVF) trials, using oocytes from ovaries obtained at an abattoir.  The addition of the FA- I mAb to the fertilization medium resulted in a linear decrease in fertilization rates (p [ 0.01). The S-AA-1 mAb had no affect (p ] 0. 10) on fertilization rates under any conditions used in this study.

It is found that the presence of the asymmetric nonlinear gain causes the longitudinal modes of Fabry-Perot lasers as well as nearly single-mode lasers to couple such that the low frequency RIN is greatly enhanced. This enhanced low frequency RIN can be translated to the signal band by beating with the modulation signal and contribute to the in-channel noise in high frequency applications. This can seriously degrade system's signal-to-noise performance. For the first time we have included the asymmetric mode competition to adequately model the enhanced low frequency noise and its translation to the signal channel in the presence of modulation and fiber dispersion. An experimental system, which provides a very sensitive means of noise measurement, was developed. The theoretical predictions were successfully verified by the experiments. Detailed investigations of system impairment caused by the enhanced in-channel noise, especially the degradation of system's signal-to-noise performance as a function of modulation depth, modulation frequency and fiber dispersion, were also performed. The results provide very important guidelines for system design and applications. Further, we adequately modeled laser's intermodulation distortion in the frequency range of 50MHz -- 10GHz. This model, which successfully explained the observed enhancement of low frequency IMD, was further generalized to include all the second-order and third-order IMDs of up to 60 channel signals, and was used to predict the impairment of multichannel lightwave systems.","Ph.

Fundamental to the frustration of statewide prohibition were the divisions and misconceptions of the evangelical Protestants.

Consequently, inferences made from the respondents to the population of interest will be subject to nonresponse bias. Using results adjusted for nonresponse, the size and number of angler specialization groups were estimated. Knowledge of the number and size of specialization groups can be used by fishery managers to relate the different types of experiences sought by the angler population. A 10-page mail questionnaire was sent to a stratified random sample of 9,981 Texas fishing license holders. Information was collected on fishing experience, fishing participation, species preferences, attitudes, and orientation to fisheries management efforts. A response rate of 62% was obtained (excluding non-deliverables). Adjustments for nonresponse were made using the method of response propensity stratification. Individual response probabilities were determined using logistic regression with a binary variable indicating response as the dependent variable and the external variables age, sex, race, and purchase date of fishing license. Response probabilities were inverted, sorted, and grouped into cells to obtain mean nonresponse adjustment weights. Statistically significant nonresponse bias was detected when unadjusted survey variables were compared with adjusted variables.

However, during the summer they were generally restricted to cool aquatic habitats protected from exposure by direct sunlight. These protected habitats most commonly occur in the brackish marshes located along the coastal regions of the county. A fire effectively eliminated Cx. salinarius larval breeding within a brackish marsh during the summer of 1989 by removing the protective canopy of emergent vegetation thereby exposing water in breeding sites to the warming effects of direct sunlight. An attempt to use clear-cutting of vegetation to reduce Cx. salinarius breeding in this area was not successful. Adult populations were found year round in Chambers County with peak densities in April/May and September /October. Individual broods of mosquitoes were influenced by amount of rainfall and ambient temperatures. The largest females were collected in colder months and from light traps close to the coast of Chambers County. Regardless of the season, Cx. salinarius had two primary peaks of flight activity: one just after sunset and the other just before sunrise. These peaks are determined by changes in light intensity. During the colder months of the year these peaks occur closer to twilight hours of early evening and early morning than during the warmer months. Peaks in flight activity also occurred during the night and were influenced by the appearance of the full moon and low wind. Flight activity was reduced by high wind, heavy precipitation and cold temperatures. Fewer intermediate peaks in flight activity were observed on new moon nights than on full moon nights.

A group of 26 male grass frogs (Rana pipiens) were size matched and placed into two groups, a drug group (D) and a control group (C). Following a four week feeding and acclimatization period, the D group received an oral dose of fenoterol at a dosage of 2.0mg/kg/day for eight weeks. The C group was given an equal volume (1.5ml) of distilled water. At the end of the eight weeks, the animals were sacrificed and the sartorius muscles were removed. Muscles were electrically stimulated using a series of five tetanizing trains (>90v, 100Hz for 300ms) separated by a 120 sec rest interval and peak tetanic tensions (PPT) were recorded. Muscles were then blotted and weighed. Total protein content of each muscle was computed from nitrogen content using the micro-kjeldahl technique. Gel electrophoresis and densitometry were used to measure myosin content (MTOT) as an indicator of contractile protein content. No significant difference in sartorius weight was seen in the drug versus control group (p<.0709). Additionally, there was no significant difference between groups in the values for total protein (p<.666) or myosin to total protein ration (p<.075).  Myosin content was 23.6% greater in the D group (D=11.65mg, C=9.41mg), and peak tetanic tension was 13.9% (D=72.57, C=63.72) greater in the D group compared to controls. MANCOVA showed a statistically significant difference between groups (Wilke's criterion=0.7428, p<.038).

The pursuit EOG was analyzed to detect and classify fast events and differentiate such events from smooth pursuit and slow phase components of eye movements before calculating important parameters related to eye displacement and velocity. The fast event and smooth pursuit parameters were entered as independent variables in multiple regression models (monocular and combined) to determine the relative and absolute correlations between BAC and oculomotor parameters. The purpose of this study was twofold: 1.) to determine if the alcohol nystagmus phenomenon and the impairment of the central nervous system due to ethanol could be detected by computer during single-frequency ocular pursuit tasks; and 2.) to determine if BAC can be estimated non-invasively from ocular pursuit responses. Three types of models, two monocular models (Right Eye, Left Eye) and one combined model (Left and Right Eyes) under two categories (Relative and Absolute), were developed using the responses from all the subjects. The Relative models were developed with measurements relative to the baseline (i.e., measurements at BAC=0.00%); the Absolute models were developed with the actual measurements...","Ph.

These respondents consisted of 21 Houston Theological Seminary students, and 39 Dallas Theological Seminary students, of which 21 were immigrating students and 18 were non-immigrating students. The Questionnaire on Socioeconomic and Demographic Characteristics, the Profile of Seminarians (POS), and the Sociocultural Assimilation Questionnaire (SAQ) were administered to the respondents. The major findings that emerged from the analysis of the data in this study are as follows: First, there were differences between Houston and Dallas Theological Seminary students in 12 demographic variables and between Korean immigrating and non-immigrating students at the Dallas Theological Seminary in four out of 16 demographic variables as measured by the Questionnaire on Socioeconomic and Demographic Characteristics. Second, generally speaking, Houston and Dallas seminary students were not different on religious orientation as measured by The Profile of Seminarians. Differences were found in only 22 variables out of 103 variables of the instrument. Differences in two variables were found between immigrating and non-immigrating students at the Dallas Theological Seminary. In terms of demography and religious orientation, immigrating and non-immigrating students were homogeneous. Third, differences in 12 out of the 24 variables measured by the Sociocultural Assimilation Questionnaire were found among the three groups.

X-ray lithography is an ideal candidate technology for the production of microelectronic devices with sizes between 0.3-0.5 microns. Industrial x-ray lithography requires the x-ray source, which is the electron storage ring, to be as compact and reliable as possible. In this thesis I review and develop the basic physical principles governing the design of compact electron synchrotrons for x-ray lithography. I explore the various aspects of lattice design for this application. I argue that the optimal storage ring design consists of a four fold symmetric cell lattice with two quadrupole families and 90° zero gradient dipole magnets. I demonstrate that radiation requirements for lithography and the use of zero gradient magnetic dipole fields constrains the lattice to four or more dipole magnets. I develop a lattice design for x-ray lithography following this logic. I then develop a dipole magnet design for a machine using this lattice. Particle tracking data is integrated into the magnet design and used to optimize the end coil configurations of the magnets. I then review the magnet's physical construction and measurement.

By superimposing the painted building design from the computer-aided design (CAD) system onto a digitized image of the intended location, a composite image was achieved. These techniques have advantages in creating realistic composite images of proposed building designs in their intended location within a short period of time. In order to provide more visual clues, a multiple view presentation was examined. In addition, the research attempted to present the video-computer in an animation sequence. This was done by creating a series of sequential composite images, and recording them frame by frame onto the video tape. Then, the animation presentation was played back in real time. The animation presentations were evaluated by comparing them with the multiple view presentations. Manual rendering and single viewpoint displays were also included in the comparisons in order to aid in interpretation of the results. Questionnaires were used to measure the capability of each presentation format in communicating the building design information to non-architecturally trained persons. The results indicate that video-computer presentations were equal to or better than manual rendering. The video-computer presentations, with their short production time, were more practical to use in the architectural process than the conventional presentations. The results of the comparisons revealed that video-computer presentations in animation format were superior to those of multiple view format in the depth cue category. On the other hand, video-computer presentations by multiple view format was found to be superior to animation format in communicating both size and scale. These results occurred under the different complexity levels of the buildings used.","Ph.

Thus, design and analysis of high performance MIN architecture have become very important.  This dissertation addresses the following issues relating to the design and analysis of buffered multistage interconnection networks (MINs): (1) Design of a novel synchronization clock and analysis of its performance in comparison to the existing clock design, (2) Design of a new multi-queue buffer allocation scheme and development of a unified analytical model for analyzing various multi-queue buffer allocation schemes, (3) Performance evaluation of nonuniform traffic load for various buffering strategies, and (4) Performance analysis of adaptive buffer splitting, and priority-based selection strategies in MINs.  Traditional MIN design used a big synchronization clock to transfer a package from one stage to the next. This design is difficult to scale because the clock cycle length depends on the network size. We propose a small synchronization clock cycle design that is independent of the network size and thus is easy to implement. Its performance is also shown to be better than the big cycle design.  Buffer design and allocations have significant effects on the system performance. We propose a new Dynamically Allocated Fully Connected (DAFC) scheme and show that it performs better than the existing schemes by developing a unified analytical model.  Most performance evaluation of interconnection networks focuses on uniform analysis. In reality, applications involve many nonuniform traffic patterns. Nonuniform traffic can further be classified into symmetric and arbitrary patterns. We first develop an analytical model to evaluate various buffer allocation schemes under arbitrary traffic patterns and show that the DAFC scheme we have proposed has the best performance over the existing buffer schemes under both uniform and nonuniform load.  We also develop an analytical model to evaluate a typical symmetric nonuniform pattern--favorite load which has applications in both multiprocessor systems and ATM switches. By using this analytical model, we investigate performance features under different priority-based selection policies and buffer splitting strategies.","Ph.

Chemical formulation rate was controlled independent of spray rate by variation of formulation concentration within the spray mixture. Experiments were conducted to evaluate mixing uniformity and accuracy with respect to injection equipment and locations. Two different metering pumps (peristaltic and plunger) and three different injection locations (pump intake, boom supply line and nozzle body) were tested on a sprayer test stand. The time required to displace the liquid volume between the injection point and the nozzle with a new concentration, response time, was determined using a water soluble dye and colorimeter. For the different configurations tested, injection at the nozzle provided the fastest response to change in dye concentration. A chemical injection system was installed on a spray aircraft and tested for performance and accuracy. A dye concentrate was injected into the boom supply line just before to the y-strainer. Metering pump flow rate was based on aerial application parameters of speed, swath width and formulation rate. Injection accuracy and mixing uniformity were compared for the injection system and for conventional tank mixing and fell within the [plus or minus] 10% desired accuracy range. However, response time of the system did cause application errors on initial start-up and during on/off spray valve operation.

In a greenhouse study, germination of stratified and non-stratified willow oak (Quercus phellos) acorns decreased following submergence for 90 d, whereas germination of the more water-tolerant overcup oak (Q. lyrata) peaked during this treatment.  Experimental studies on the effects of timing and duration of flooding on BLHW seedling growth and survival were conducted on Texas Utilities' Big Brown Mine in Fairfield, Texas. The order of survival within each of the three treatments was from the most to least water-tolerant species and was as follows: baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), overcup oak, Nuttall oak (Q. texana), willow oak, and Shumard oak (Q. shumardii). Baldcypress exhibited significantly (P $<$.05) greater growth than hardwoods in all three treatments.  Field studies conducted within two green-tree reservoirs (GTR) in east Texas indicated that overcup oak seedling establishment and survival was related negatively to duration of flooding. Stress and mortality of overstory trees differed inter- and intra-specifically. Temporal and spatial patterns of overstory mortality suggested mortality was a result of cumulative flooding events over a series of years rather than the amount of flooding in any single year. Stand-structure analyses indicated regeneration had been limited in both impoundments in the recent past, possibly before the pre-impoundment period.  A simulation model, GTREE, was constructed to evaluate the effects of GTR management on seedling growth and survival of overcup oak, water elm (Planera aquatica), and willow oak. The number of seedlings reaching sapling height and the time needed to reach sapling height were dependent upon duration of time flooded during the growing season, the dormant-season flood depth, and light availability. Regeneration was limited as light availability or the duration of time flooded during the growing season approached an extreme for that species.","Ph.

Conventional secondarty methods cannot be applied to this type of reservoirs because injected fluids channel though the fractures bypassing oil trapped in the matrix blocks. Spontaneous water imbibition is an spontaneous mechanism that could be applied. The process exchanges oil inside the rock matrix for surrounding water filling the fractures. However, the process is very time dependent. Oil distribution inside carbonated rock samples, and the effects of introducing CO2 into the water being imbibed were studied using Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI. Oil saturation profiles and longitudinal images along the sample were used to monitor water imbibition. A high pressure core holder suitable for MRI and CT applications was developed using commercial fiber glass tubing. Development of the new tool permitted imbibition of unadulterated and carbonated water to be studied at a reservoir pressure of 2000 psi. Different cases were studies: (1) Imbibition of unadulterated water, (2) Imbibition of CO2 - enriched water, and (3) Cyclic CO2 - enriched water imbibition and pressure depletion. Introduction of CO2 into the water being imbibed showed improvements in oil recovery rates during early times of the process. Pressure depletion caused expansion of gas dissolved into the imbibed water. This mechanism probed to cause a substantial oil increase. Oil recovery by CO2 - enriched water imbibition and pressure depletion were combined to develop a cyclic method that integrated the beneficial effects encountered at early times and gas expansion caused by pressure depletion. The cyclic method reduced recovery time to nearly one third of the time needed to produce similar amounts of oil by pure water imbibition.","Ph.

Lane keeping is a critical performance measure for safe driving. This study looked at the effect of driver age, type of data entry (manual or verbal), and vertical position of a data display panel on lane keeping performance. The experimental tasks were similar to those found in in-vehicle navigation systems and cellular phones. A no-load condition was studied to establish a baseline for the performance measures. Both older and younger drivers exhibit lateral deviations of approximately 15 cm under no-load conditions. Under manual data entry conditions all drivers exhibited lateral lane deviations in excess of the no-load condition. Lateral deviations greater than 0.5 meters occurred in 6.2% of all manual data entry trials. The maximum deviation recorded was over 2 meters. Verbal data entry of data was clearly superior to manual data entry for all measures. Younger drivers consistently performed better than older drivers with lower errors and faster time to complete experimental trials. However there was no difference between driver age groups for lane keeping performance. While placing the data display panel in high position yielded better performance for all measures.

Cluster secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was evaluated in comparison to plasma desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) and monoatomic SIMS. A cluster ion source was designed based on the spontaneous desorption (SD) process. The parameters affecting the SD were studied to optimize the cluster source performance. These factors were extraction grid vs. aperture, aperture size, source bias, source distance, and time. Under optimized SD conditions signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) up to approximately 27 were obtained for the production of CsI cluster ions. The ions of interest from the source were I' and (CsI)[n]I' clusters (where n is the cluster order). For our source a 3 mm gridless aperture 8 mm from the source foil produced the highest signal-to-noise ratio at 18 kV on the source. A signal-to-noise maximum was reached after the sample was biased for 12 hours. The SI yields from organic targets were compared for monoatomic keV ions, MeV ions (252Cf fission fragments), and polyatomic keV ions. The energy range of the clusters used was 18 to 27 keV. This comparison was made by calculating secondary ion yields for the molecular ions from a given sample. The organic samples used were epinephrine, γ-aminobutyric acid, phenylalanine, and valine. For cluster bombardment secondary ion yields ranged from 0.53% for epinephrine to 3.45% for phenylalanine. These yields are less than the molecular ion yields from PDMS which ranged from 3.09% for epinephrine to 7.00% for phenylalanine.

Manual and mechanical covering were applied in different experiments. The onion shoulder color was measured with a tristimulus colorimeter. The color characterization was done with the Hunter Lab scale. Several whiteness indexes were calculated. Early covering, four to six weeks before harvest, clearly reduced shoulder greening and increased whiteness in all the white onion varieties tested. Covering did not have a detrimental effect on yield. Mechanical cover was satisfactorily performed with three-spider rolling cultivators. Early covering did not have an effect on the incidence of rots.

The influence that these particles have on permanent deformation is investigated in this research study. A comprehensive field evaluation is presented to prove that physical characteristics of sand-size aggregate particles have a strong influence on rutting. A detailed laboratory investigation is carried out in order to (1) quantify the influence on resistance to rutting when rounded, smooth, sand-sized aggregate particles are replaced by rough, angular, porous particles, and (2) evaluate the ability of test procedures to identify good rutting resistant mixtures, based on the quality of the sand-sized particles. A state of the art theoretical approach is described and developed. In this approach, hyperbolic equations are introduced to model the compressive creep and recovery compliances, and the aggregate's role in the permanent deformation behavior of the mixture is assessed by means of a new parameter: the ""p"" value. The new compliance equations are further developed into a rutting prediction model. A new technique based on image processing is applied to the characterization of texture in sand-sized aggregate particles. The technique is known as fractal analysis. Octahedral shear stress theory is used to evaluate potential to rutting of asphalt concrete mixes containing low quality sand-sized particles (rounded, smooth, non-porous) and high quality sand-sized particles (rough, angular, porous). A combination of the new theoretical approach, the laboratory long-term performance of the mix, and the octahedral shear stress analysis, is recommended as the preferred approach to evaluate the influence of sand-sized aggregate particles on permanent deformation in asphalt concrete mixtures.","Ph.

Two numerical techniques for the evaluation of the path integrals are developed and their relative merits discussed. One of them, called the stationary phase Monte Carlo (SPMC) method, which is found to be particularly well suited for wave propagation over long distances, is implemented to analyze wave propagation in a system involving arbitrary-shaped, smoothly varying, and transversely inhomogeneous dielectrics. The other technique, called the Fourier transform path integral (FTPI) method, which provides a unified treatment for computing electromagnetic fields in a region that contains intersecting or isolated dielectric bodies that are homogeneous, inhomogeneous or perfect conductors, is implemented to analyze general wave scattering in one- or two-dimensional configurations. The SPMC method is specifically applied to wave propagation in a graded-index waveguide, while the FTPI method is used to solve for the scattered field from a variety of one- and two-dimensional planar structures due to line source excitation.

This research has involved using two different calibration methods, the CMM and VBAT, to calibrate PUMA 560 manipulator, and studied the relationship between the global and local calibration. The CMM method can measure the complete tool pose information with a special 5-tooling ball end effector, and the VBAT method can provide the partial tool pose measurement by using an automatic tracking camera which works as a single theodolite. In this work, the robot calibration procedure is based on a model which is the extension of the modified Hartenberg-Denavit model. The deviations between the kinematic model used in the robot controller and the actual kinematic structure of a given robot are in terms of the small perturbation of the parameters of the selected model. Since it is assumed that the acquired data will have measurement error, a least squares technique is employed to optimize the solution. Simulations are used to demonstrate that the selected model is adequate to model a six degree-of-freedom manipulator, to study the effect of the measurement error, and to show the data filter can work. The most important results is that the simulations show that the observability index can be misleading if the reliability of the data is not check first, this is never observed in previous work. Finally, the experimental data are used to compare the identified parameters of the two different methods, the prediction error of the global and local calibrations, and the existence of the unmodeled factors. The global and local calibrations results show that there are significant differences between them, and local calibration is an effective way to improve manipulator performance. The parameters identified by using a particular local space data can predict the position of the poses in that local space best, and get worse when the poses are further away the particular local space. The global calibration results show that the parameters identified by using the global space data can predict the position of the poses in the global space within a range which is worse than the results of local calibration in each local space.","Ph.

The objective of this research was to describe and quantify aspects of birch colonization and stand development on severely eroded sites, which could be used to develop strategies for landscape restoration. Patterns of birch colonization were inferred from age/size structure and spatial distribution of birch populations on disturbed sites in southern and northeastern Iceland. In addition, long-term changes in birch cover were quantified from aerial photographs. Increases in birch abundance occurred as existing birch clusters expanded and coalesced and produced seeds which germinated and initiated birch clusters that subsequently served as foci for additional colonization. Ectomycorrhizal infectivity, as estimated by the most probable number technique, was twenty-five to thirty-five times lower in soils from disturbed sites than observed for soil collected from a developing birch stand. Even so, mycorrhizae did develop on roots of birch seedlings grown on these disturbed soils in a controlled environment. The distribution of seedlings was quantified along belt transects radiating from birch clusters and isolated birch plants and related to seed rain and ground cover. Seed dispersal curves tended to be unimodal with a log-linear decrease in seed density with increased distance from the seed source. Patterns of seedling density seemed to reflect the interaction between seed rain and the availability of safe-sites. Field experiments were designed to evaluate the suitability of some common microsites (mineral soil, gravel, rock, moss cushions, dwarf-shrub and grass) for birch seedling establishment. Germination from a one-time dissemination and seedling survival were monitored for two years. Seedling emergence was greater in non-vegetated than vegetated microsites, but seedling survival was generally lower in non-vegetated microsites. The majority of seedling mortality occurred during winter on all microsites. Suitability of non-vegetated microsites for seedling establishment was augmented by low-level fertilization that served to enhance overwinter survival. The results are discussed in relation to strategies for restoration of birch woodlands on eroded and disturbed sites.","Ph.

A field and two growth chamber studies were conducted to determine N fertility effects on ethylene production throughout development of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plants and plant parts. The association between changes in ethylene production due to N fertility and fruiting form abscission was also investigated. Nitrogen-deficient cotton plants exhibit increased rates of fruiting form abscission. Since ethylene is a potent promoter of abscission, it is implicated as a factor in this process. For all experiments, cotton plants were fertilized with NH4NO3 at planting at 0, 50, 100, or 150 kg N ha^-1. For the whole-plant study, ethylene production was measured using a flow-through system designed to collect ethylene from enclosed plants. Ethylene evolution from leaf discs of topmost fully expanded, middle, and bottom leaves of the canopy was determined in a growth chamber and a one-year field study. In addition, ethylene production from 3-d-old, 18-d-old, and 24-d-old squares, and 3-d-old bolls was sampled from field-grown plants. The whole-plant, growth chamber study was variable, but generally suggested ethylene production was increased for control plants. In addition, this response was unaffected by day temperature (28 or 35°C). Ethylene production of whole plants significantly decreased from 21 to 63 days after emergence (DAE). Ethylene evolution from leaf discs of the bottom leaves of the canopy of growth chamber-grown cotton plants was significantly increased for control plants at 14 DAE. However, from 21 to 42 DAE, ethylene production of those leaves increased with the amount of N applied. Older leaf tissue of field-grown cotton plants exhibited increased ethylene production with the amount of N applied, but only during the bloom period. Ethylene production by field-grown and growth chamber-grown plants increased with leaf age. Ethylene production by fruiting forms was not influenced by N fertilization, and abscission rates were not associated with ethylene production of fruiting forms, which suggested the fruit shed associated with a N deficiency might involve other hormones related to the abscission process.","Ph.

G. Don was characterized. Uptake of alkaloids by mesophyll protoplasts was found to have two components: a rapid, non-specific diffusion of the alkaloid, driven by the pH gradient between the vacuole and the external medium; and a slower, energy dependent uptake which was specific for at least some of the alkaloids endogenous to C. roseus. The concentration and pH dependence for uptake of vindoline suggested the rapid phase of uptake was due to non-mediated diffusion of the neutral form of vindoline. Uptake of nicotine, which is not endogenous to Catharanthus, also conformed to the kinetics of simple diffusion. In the case of vindoline, the second sustained phase of uptake could be selectively inhibited by pretreatment of the protoplasts with NaN3 for 10 min. Metabolism of the alkaloids was ruled out as a possible cause of the observed biphasic uptake. The importance of ion-trapping of the alkaloids inside the cell was demonstrated by a rapid efflux of both vindoline and ajmalicine induced by NH4CI. There was a slow component to the efflux of ajmalicine which was not seen with vindoline, which could have been due to binding of the ajmalicine to either phenolics or counterions in the vacuole. In order to begin to extend the transport studies to the subcellular level, procedures were developed for the reliable isolation of vacuoles from mesophyll protoplasts. A combination of osmotic shock, followed by ultracentrifugation on step gradients of Ficoll was found to give a good yield of vacuoles with little contamination by non-vacuolar components. Binding of FITC-agglutinin (from Abrus precatorius) to the plasma membrane was found to give a rapid, semi-quantitative estimate of the contamination of the purified vacuoles by vacuoplasts. The plasma membrane and tonoplast ATPases were found on sucrose gradients at d=1.13-1.14 and d=1.105 respectively.

In Study 1, the 2 X 2 MANOVA, with the independent variables being sex of actor and sex of target, was not significant.

In Study 3, the 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 MANOVA, with the independent variables being sex of actor, sex of target, resource level of actor, and resource level of target, was not significant. Univariate analyses revealed partial support for the hypothesis that gender and relative position of strength together influence power strategy use. Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients performed on data from all three studies revealed significant relationships between assertive behavior and power strategy use, and between self-concept and power strategy use.

The Soviet Union was seen as proof that central planning could take a backward peasant economy and transform it into a modern industrial power. Empiricists began to question these beliefs in the 1960s, but were hindered be the lack of reliable data. Studies performed in the 1980s demonstrated the existence of output and investment cycles in particular planned economies, but no comparisons were made with market-type economies. The relationship between investment and output in centrally planned economies was not explored. This dissertation presents a comparison of output stability in centrally planned and market-type economies. It uses data from the United Nations International Comparison Project which allow output to be compared across countries and across time. The results indicate that there was no statistically significant difference in output stability between the two types of economy. The analytical framework that predicts greater stability for centrally planned economies requires that investment be an important determinant of output; property rights approaches predict that output will determine investment. The relationship between investment and output is examined in this dissertation with two tests of causality, and it is found that investment does not determine output in centrally planned economies. In some cases output is found to weakly determine investment. The dissertation concludes with a comparison of mean growth rates in centrally planned and market-type economies. Again, no significant difference is found between the two groups. Possible reasons for this result are discussed.","Ph.

The transformed VSP is readily interpretable and easier to tie with surface seismic. A model-dependent transformation approach applicable to a general 2-D subsurface model has been developed. The transformation works by first determining a velocity-depth model consistent with the VSP data. Then using the model and raytracing we determine and relocate each primary event at its correct reflection point. The transformation generates both time and depth sections. The tune section generated from the depth model using the concept of image ray tracing. Since the transformation is basically an application of a moveout correction to the VSP traces), its effect is to distort the original waveform on the VSP trace and consequently smear the reflection event in both space and time. This smearing of the events degrades the lateral resolution of the transformation and therefore must be minimized by using optimum aquisition and processing parameters. An important step in the transformation procedure is the stacking of the moveout corrected traces at constant com m on reflection point (CRP) intervals. In this research the criteria for the determination of the optimum bin size is defined. The minimum bin size must be such that with in the zone of subsurface coverage there is at least one reflection point in each bin on each reflector. The maximum bin size must be such that the distortion across the bin is less than some acceptable value which depends on the objectives of the survey. The above criteria are particulary advantageous when stacking multi-offset VSP data. One of the main objectives of this research is to investigate the class of 2-D models for which the transformation is applicable. Time transformation is applicable to all classes of 2-D model for which the VSP time T is single-valued in the two-way timer and also the emergent image ray offset E is not multi-valued in r. Depth transformation is applicable to all classes of 2-D model for which the VSP time T is single-valued in the reflection depth Z and also the reflection offset X is not multivalued in Z. Since the transformation is model-dependent, it correctly transforms only those events whose dip, depth and velocity are included or interpolated from the model. All other events though not imaged perfectly, will be positioned in a manner that facilitates interpretation. The transformation was successfully tested on both synthetic and real VSP data.","Ph.

This study examined phytotoxicity of methomyl (S-methyl-N- [(methylcarbamoyl)oxy]-thioacetimidate) on cotton (Gossvpium hirsutum L.), with special reference to leaf spotting and photosynthetic activity. Three sets of experiments were performed. The objectives in the first set of experiments were 1) to establish the time courses of photosynthetic injury and leaf reddening and 2) to examine relationships between carbon exchange rate (CER), stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco) in leaves of methomyl-treated, field-grown cotton. In methomyl-treated leaves, CERs, stomatal conductance, rubisco, and chlorophyll fluorescence all decreased after spraying, but recovered to levels near to controls. The CERs were more closely related to stomatal conductance than to chlorophyll fluorescence or rubisco. Ethylene production is often associated with plant stress. The objective of the second set of experiments was to determine if ethylene is involved in methomyl-induced photosynthetic injury and leaf reddening. Cotton plants grown in environmentally controlled growth chambers were treated with 0, 2, 4, or 8 mM Ag (an ethylene action inhibitor). Three hours later, plants were sprayed with methomyl or a control spray. Silver treatment alleviated methomyl-induced decreases in CER, usually by hastening recovery, but occasionally by nearly eliminating injury. Once again, CERs were more strongly related to stomatal conductance than to chlorophyll fluorescence. Leaf spotting in methomyl-treated leaves was alleviated, but not eliminated, by Ag treatment. Various physiological and cultural considerations may affect severity of phytotoxicity. Thus, the objective of the third set of experiments was to determine effects of spray number, leaf position, and methomyl rate on methomyl-induced photosynthetic injury and leaf spotting of field-grown cotton. Percent spotting was greater in younger leaves than in older leaves. Whole-plot reddening was greater with two sprays than with one spray and greater at 0.84 kg ha^-1 methomyl than at 0.62 kg ha^-1.

A constitutive equation based on transient network theory, following the original formulation of Marrucci et al.

Evaluating this constitutive equation to predict the shear stresses arising in LAOS with wall slip, using a previously proposed slip boundary condition (18), shows that this slip boundary condition is insufficient to predict the observed unstable stresses that arise in LAOS with wall slip. The critical strain amplitude at which unstable stresses arise in LAOS has been shown to correspond with the critical shear rate for the onset of melt fracture in extrusion, for untreated molten polymers. This observation can be used to develop a procedure to evaluate the melt fracture ""potential"" of polymer melts. Polymer processing additives are shown to have two distinct types of effects on the wall slip of molten polymers in LAOS. Two additives are shown to decrease the critical strain amplitude for the onset of unstable stresses in LAOS while another additive increases the critical strain amplitude.

The rotating cavity has two plane disks and a cylindrical rim (shroud). The ratio of the rim span to the disk outer radius is 0.4 and the ratio of the disk inner radius to outer radius is 0.25. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of axial coolant flow rate, rotational speed, and disk surface temperature on the local heat transfer coefficient distributions inside the disk cavity. Six disk surface heating conditions (BC1, BC2, BC3, BC4, BC5 and BC6) were tested for the axial flow Reynolds numbers between 2500 and 25,000, the rotational Reynolds numbers between 0 and 5.11x10^5 and the rotational Grashof numbers between 1.8x10^6 and 2.2x10^10, respectively. The results showed that the disk cavity local heat transfer coefficients for the non-rotating cavity increase with increasing axial flow Reynolds number. However, the cavity local heat transfer coefficients decrease with increasing rotational Reynolds number and then increase with further increasing rotational Reynolds number. The downstream disk and rim generally have higher Nusselt numbers than the upstream disk. The Nusselt numbers on the upstream disk for BC 4, BC 5 and BC 6 are respectively lower than BC 1 and the Nusselt numbers on the downstream disk for BC 3, BC 5 and BC 6 are respectively lower than BC 1. However, the uneven disk temperature effect on the local Nusselt numbers decrease with decreasing axial Reynolds number and decrease with low rotational Reynolds number (Re[x] = 0 - 3.19x10^5), however, increase with high rotational Reynolds number (Re[x] = 5.11x10^5). The disk cavity Nusselt numbers for BC 1 and BC 2 are comparable. In general, the modified Nusselt numbers (NU[y]) on the upstream and downstream disks of this study and Farthing et al.

These are the most important compounds in the search for new porous materials. By controlling the gel chemistry, the interaction with the organic template, and reaction conditions the interesting compounds are separated from at least 3-5 other undesirable phases (dense phases or compound with small pore size). AIPO4-8 observed as a secondary phase in the different synthesis procedures to prepare H1, was obtained from a more viscous gel than the one used in the DPA system with all the other conditions similar to prepare HI. VPI-5 and H1 were found to be structurally similar but with some different physical properties, for example H1 was found thermally unstable with a phase transformation to AIPO[4]-8 at 100-300°C while VPI-5 was found stable at temperatures even higher than 650°C. The differences between these two compounds appear to be related to a structural aluminum excess in HI which represents weak structural sites where hydrolysis and or bond failure can occur with a ready transformation to AIPO[4]-8 . The solid state NMR on samples with different water contents demonstrated that bond breaking in dehydrated samples occurs as part of a strain mechanism relaxation. In both samples, H1 and VPI-5, the same phenomena is observed with some differences in the healing process when water is readsorbed, for example a more hydrophilic character is observed in HI. The strain relaxation is supported by an expansion in the c-axis and contraction of the a-axis as determined by the unit cell parameters of hydrated and dehydrated samples. Isomorphous elemental substitution in H1 and or VPI-5 is indicated to be promising for Si and Fe where about 10% of intended substitution is accepted into the framework by the reaction synthesis. Other metals such as Co, Mg, and Mn are supported to a lesser extent or direct the synthesis to other aluminophosphate phases.","Ph.

An updated vector of ""inputed values"" is used at each iteration. This produces the generalized average (GAVE) method, which is a natural extension of the AVE method used for balanced data.

These structural shifts are exemplified by changes in regional location of production, as well as, disparate regional changes in the number and size of operations all of which have implications for milk supplies. As a result of these structural changes, the economic models used to forecast policy impacts on the dairy industry proved inaccurate. Traditionally, dairy supply models utilized long time series data to forecast milk production and thus their results may be dominated by trend variables rather than economic variables. There have been few analyses that incorporate the natural biological process of herd growth to determine future herd inventories and milk supply. Another, more important problem with previous modelling attempts has been the lack of attention given to the structural changes that have occurred in the dairy industry. The majority of the current milk supply models are aggregate or national models and are therefore incapable of providing detailed information about dairy industry changes. For example, there have not been any analyses providing information about replacement heifer movement from areas raising surplus replacement to deficit areas. This analysis developed a methodology that utilized biological information about herd dynamics to determine future daily herd size and milk supplies. Two models to predict future milk supply were developed using this methodology: an aggregate U.S. model and a regional model. Due to the limited amount of data, econometrics combined with optimal control was used to estimate values for unknown parameters in the models. Results from the regional model indicated that the Pacific, Upper Midwest, Corn Belt, Appalachian, and Northeast regions are net exporters of replacement heifers to other regions, while the Southern Plains and Southeast regions are net importers. The aggregate model tracked the historical trends better than the regional model in an ex post simulation and also provided more reasonable milk production forecasts. The regional model's forecasts were unacceptable.","Ph.

The history and evolution of industrial training in the United States was traced from the early 1900s to the present understandings of trainer roles and competencies. Theories of culture were then reviewed to gain an appreciation of the complexities of cross-cultural transactions arid how these complexities might affect international training and education programs. Three models, Strategic Management, Instructional Systems Development, and the CIPP Evaluation model were examined for their utility in the integration of training as a strategic part of an international organization. A variety of quantitative and qualitative paradigms were considered to test for differences in the roles and competencies of trainers in domestic positions versus those working in lesser developed countries. A survey was conducted among experts in petroleum industry training in lesser developed countries using techniques similar to those of the Delphi method, attempting to replicate the Models for Excellence (ASTD, 1983) study. Numerical data collected were sorted using a three-dimensional spreadsheet program, while qualitative statements and data were transcribed and reported.

Based on a review of the literature a conceptual model was proposed relating the need for affiliation and the motivation for travel. The primary objective of the study was to develop stable measurement instruments of the need for affiliation and travel motivations. This was accomplished through the use of a self-administered questionnaire administered with a convenience sample collected at four locations: (1) senior citizens living in an independent retirement community in Lee's Summit, Missouri; (2) senior citizens living in an independent retirement community in Salt Lake City, Utah; (3) students attending the REPK 301 classes at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas; and (4) students attending the RELE 192 classes at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah. The need for affiliation was measured by using the Mehrabian Affiliative Tendency Scales. Travel motivation was measured by using the Driver Recreation Experience Preference Scales for the domains of achievement, risk-taking, being with people, family togetherness, meeting-observing new people, learning-discovery, relationship with nature, reflecting on personal values, nostalgia, physical rest, escape personal-social pressures, and escape family. Type of traveler was measured using the Plog Psychocentric-Allocentric Scales. Information was obtained through a series of respondent profile and travel profile questions. The results of the study support Mehrabian's need for affiliation model and the need for affiliation and its relationship to affiliative and non-affiliative travel motivations model. All null hypotheses were rejected with the exception of the fourth null hypothesis, regarding international travel experience. With regard to the motivations for travel, there was a significant difference between sub-groups as determined by the need for affiliation, traveler type, travel experience, gender, marital status, and age with regard to the motivations for travel.","Ph.

Basic analysis of private market provision of excludable public goods is needed in order to understand the implications of transfer of service responsibility from the public sector into the private sector. This thesis provides such an analysis. We first analyze the impact of differences in the characteristics of the demand preference distribution upon the profit maximizing choices of price and output by a private monopolist. We consider two alternative pricing strategies: maximum uniform pricing and optimum uniform pricing. We characterize changes in the heterogeneity of the market demand distributions by employing the concept of mean preserving spread distributions. In our second core chapter, we provide a comparison of public goods allocations under public monopoly and private monopoly. We develop a majority voting ranking of the two alternative modes. In particular, we extend the voting analysis found in Gronberg and Hwang to include a franchise tax. This franchise tax policy increases the probability that a majority of the consumer-votes will support private monopoly provision. We identify conditions under which privatization does gain majority support when government can extract some or all of the monopolist's profits and redistributes the profit to each consumer uniformly. Finally, we analyze provision of excludable public goods when they are subject to congestion effects. We again focus upon public monopoly and private monopoly as alternative institutional arrangements for allocating public goods. We define congestion in our model as average utilization, which is total utilization divided by the quantity consumed by each individual. In equilibrium, we find that the consumers will consume lower quality (more congested) public goods under a public regime than under a private monopoly provision regime. The voting results are very similar to the case of noncongestible public goods. Public provision, in general, still dominates private monopoly provision. Private monopoly provision does dominate public provision, however, when a franchise tax is introduced. The possibility of private monopoly provision domination increases when the congestion effects increase.","Ph.

The need to advance the study of community power structures in Nigerian communities is the principal stimulus for this study. There are several perceptions of community power. This study reviewed the two major theories of social power, the elitist and pluralist. It also examined the four dominant methods for the study of community power-- the positional, reputational, decisional and a combined approach. A combination of reputational and decisional methods was used in this study to locate the Owerri decision-makers or leaders and the key issues in which the leaders were involved. Four hypotheses are analyzed: (1) key decisional areas in Owerri within the last decade is small; (2) decision making in Owerri is elitist; (3) the key decision-makers fill positions in political and economic organizations; and (4) the characteristics of the decisional leaders are varied. Twelve informants and thirty-three leaders were interviewed. They mentioned a total of sixty-one leaders and three key issues-- the land, Eze and market issues. In the land and market issues, the Owerri leaders were on one side against the state government's propositions and actions while the leaders were divided on the Eze issue. There are some similarities and differences between the findings in the Owerri community power study and those of the communities studied in the United States. There is a need for social scientists both in Nigeria and Western countries that specialized in community studies to extend their researches to Nigerian communities to provide more bases for comparison between the Nigerian communities and communities in other countries.","Ph.

We must ground our models or theories in the real experience of real people. To do so, we: (1) need to learn about the repertoire of literate activities (2) need to learn about the cultural and socio-situational circumstances that surround those activities (3) need to learn about written language itself. This dissertation makes four general contributions to generating sound models or theories of literacy or written language learning and use. 1) It proposes an understanding of literacy that allows us to ground our initial investigations of written language learning and use in the real experience of real people. 2) It offers a preliminary descriptive taxonomy of literate activities. 3) It suggests that within a single context or within a particular discourse community, there are different ways of reading and writing. 4) It lays the foundation for future research into the varieties of written language. Once we begin to explore what we do when we learn and use written language, how and why some of us learn and use written language in ways different from others, we will then also begin to explain the meaning of written language in human life.","Ph.

Twelve mature Thoroughbred horses were used to evaluate the efficacy of a fat-supplemented diet to maintain muscle glycogen stores and reduce thermal stress in exercising horses. In this study, exercising Thoroughbred horses were maintained in three body conditions (moderately low--condition score 4, moderate--condition score 5, and moderately high--condition score 6) and fed experimental diets containing similar nutrient-to-calorie ratios. The diets were (1) control (no added fat) and (2) 10% added fat. The horses performed standard exercise tests during which muscle biopsies were obtained from the biceps femoris. The muscle biopsies were utilized to determine muscle glycogen concentrations. Pre-test muscle glycogen concentrations were similar (P >.05) for horses in ML, M and MH condition groups. When the horses were fed the fat-supplemented diet, the comparable pre-test muscle glycogen concentrations were higher (P <.05) averaging 21.07, 26.06 and 24.42 mg/g, which was a 30%, 55% and 31%, increase, respectively, in resting muscle glycogen concentrations. Post-test muscle glycogen concentrations were similar (P >.05) for horses on all treatments. Trial II. Eight of the original Thoroughbreds, four males and four females were randomly divided into two groups of four with equal number of males and females. Following a pre-trial adjustment period, four horses from each treatment group were fed a control diet and the other four horses were fed a fat-supplemented diet. After the experimental period, a SET and energy balance trial was conducted. Upon completion of the energy balance trial, the horses were switched to the other diet. Again, a SET and energy balance trial were conducted. While consuming the fat-supplemented concentrate, horses had significantly lower (P <.01) total heat production. This reduction in total heat production resulted in a significant increase (P <.05) in available net energy for work for horses consuming the fat-supplemented concentrate. The heat increment of the fat-supplemented concentrate was significantly lower (P <.01) than the heat increment associated with the control diet. Thus, a significantly greater (P <.05) percentage of the net energy available in the horses consuming the fat-supplemented concentrate was available for work.","Ph.

A sample of 153 acquired firms (126 United States and 27 United Kingdom) which were acquired between 1986-1989 is analyzed. The sample is tested using data from the year prior to the acquisition as well as an average of three years prior to the acquisition, and financial ratios are deflated by industry averages to try and minimize an effect of industry differences. The conclusions of the analysis are quite interesting. In the short and long-run univariate analysis the goodwill, profitability, price-earnings and liquidity variables all proved to be significantly different when the United States and United Kingdom firms were compared.

The effect of storm and plant variables on the process of interception was analyzed by applying statistical procedures. Regression models were developed and the Gash model validated. The results of the study indicate that 80.9% of the rainfall was in the form of throughfall while 2.8% was in the form of stemflow. Application of stepwise regression determined that rainfall was the major factor contributing to the variation in throughfall (r^2 = 0.98) and stemflow (r^2 =0.71), followed by season, duration and intensity. Among the climatic factors affecting the interception process no significant difference for throughfall or stemflow was attributable to season, duration, intensity, nor to vegetation factors like canopy density, total tree height or stem circumference.

These techniques are based on Fourier transforms and their properties. They permit the use of continuous probability distribution(s) for the probability distribution resulting from the sum of discrete random variables, where each variable is statistically independent of others. It is shown that the well-known Gram-Charlier's expansion is a special case of the first technique. Using the first technique, any continuous distribution can be examined for its suitability for modeling the distribution of the sum of discrete random variables. Using the second technique, a group of continuous distributions can be examined for their suitability for modeling the distribution of the sum of discrete random variables. The aggregate distribution for the generation capacity in a power system is traditionally derived by taking the distribution of a generating unit and combining with it the distribution of another unit until all distributions are processed. Although a recursive algorithm is available for this purpose, the process is computationally very costly. Numerous attempts have been made in the last two decades to develop a continuous distribution for this purpose. Presently, the most widely used continuous technique is the cumulant method, which is most commonly expressed in Gram-Charlier's expansion. Nevertheless, the results are not quite satisfactory. In this dissertation, gamma distribution, specifically that with three parameters, is inserted in the new techniques for evaluating the generation capacity reliability and it is shown that this approach provides superior results than any other methods presently used.","Ph.

Adsorption studies were carried out in wide pressure and temperature ranges of 10^-7-10^1 Torr and 90-1000K, respectively, employing techniques of RAIRS and TPD. The adsorption of CO on Pd(111) was found to be very sensitive for the preparation conditions of the adsorbed CO layer. In contrast, no effect of preparation conditions was seen on the adsorption of CO on Pd(100). By carrying out CO adsorption measurements under isobaric conditions, isosteric heats of adsorption were determined for Pd(111), Pd(100) and Cu/Rh(100) as a function of CO coverage. Discontinuities in the isobaric plots were observed in the range of the phase transition of adsorbed CO layers due to the different IR absorption cross sections of CO molecules in different adsorption positions. For Pd(111) an equilibrium phase diagram was constructed which shows the continuity of CO adsorption phases with increasing CO pressure and surface temperature. Excellent agreement was found between IR spectra of equilibrated CO layers on Pd(111) and Pd(100) single crystals and a Pd/SiO2 catalyst which suggests that the small metal particles on a support have crystal faces with mostly (111) and (100) orientations. Results of elevated pressure kinetic and IR measurements for the oxidation of CO on Pd(111) and Pd(100) strongly support the generally accepted correspondence between the heat of CO adsorption and the activation energy. Therefore, we believe that as far as the adsorption of CO is structure sensitive, the oxidation of carbon monoxide is structure sensitive, as well. Deposition of Cu on the Rh(100) surface results in an increase in catalytic activity for CO oxidation.

Sorghum malt was added to the composites to produce drinkable weaning foods. Millet was decorticated and then extruded at several moisture levels. Decortication of millet caused increased starch content and in vitro protein digestibility and decreased protein, lysine, threonine and histidine contents and C-PER. Extrusion at 15% moisture of decorticated (76% yield) millet produced the highest radial expansion, water solubility index and cold viscosity. Extrusion increased the water absorption (WAI) and solubility (WSI) indices, enzyme susceptible starch (ESS) and in vitro protein digestibility of millet. Highly expanded millet extrudate has potential for production of baby foods, snacks or breakfast cereals. Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) was used to test the sorghum malt quality and liquefying power on precooked flour. Maximum diastatic activity occurred in sorghum germinated for 3-4 days. In vitro protein digestibility, lysine content and C-PER increased during germination. Sorghum malt was able to liquefy precooked rice or millet pastes within 5 min at 30°C. The RVA adequately measured diastatic activity in a relatively short time using small malt samples. Decorticated millet flour was heated in water and pressed against a hot griddle (press-drying) to produce dry flakes. WAI, WSI and ESS of decorticated millet flour increased after press-drying. This flour had adequate paste property for weaning food preparation. Dehulled cowpea was boiled, ground and press-dried. Press-drying increased the WAI and decreased the WSI of cowpea. Weaning food from extruded or press-dried millet flour (70%) and press-dried cowpea flour (30%) formed smooth pastes after mixing with cold water. Treatment with 5% sorghum malt produced drinkable foods. All experimental and commercial composites had ESS values of >85%. The composites had >17% protein content and >90% of the essential amino acids of the FAO/WHO protein pattern for children less than 1 yr old.

Non-recursive order N formulations for the transient dynamic analysis of multibody systems can be achieved using range space methods. Unlike the recursive methods, this formulation does not rely on system topology to induce parallelism. These methods induce concurrency via the method of subdomain decomposition, and it is shown that they are amenable to implementation on the forthcoming class of highly parallel architectures. This class of formulations can be distinguished from other variants of sub-domain decomposition in that redundant degrees of freedom are retained, and the coupling of substructures is achieved by explicitly calculating the coupling forces in an order N computational cost. A preconditioned conjugate gradient method is used for the range space solution, with a preconditioner motivated by the directed graph of multibody systems with no closed chains. The method is shown to be rapidly convergent for linear and nonlinear structural systems with a large number of degrees of freedom. One potential drawback of the range space formulation is the well known constraint violation drift associated with redundant formulations of transient multibody dynamics. This dissertation introduces a family of concurrent constraint violation stabilization algorithms that retain the order N computational cost of the range space formulation, while ensuring simulation fidelity. The hybrid methods introduced are based upon penalty multibody formulations and augmented Lagrangian formulations. Explicit bounds on measures of the constraint violation are presented. It is shown that, in the augmented Lagrangian method, the number of fixed iterations per time step dictate the diameters of the attractors of constraint violations in phase space. Several numerical examples of simulation and control are presented including simulations of the Space Station Freedom, the NASA Langley Control Structure Interaction Evolutionary model and nonlinear, multi-rigid bodies articulating in space.","Ph.

Biostratigraphy and diversity determinations were made on 177 samples and stable isotope ratios for oxygen and carbon were measured on the coccolith fraction of 140 samples. The interval examined extends from the Maastrichtian Reinhardtites levis Zone (74.5 m.y.) to the Paleocene Discoaster mohleri Zone (60.6 m.y.). A drastic change in δ[^13]C ratios (1.4[ppt]) was recorded at Site 525A in a 1.62 m interval across the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary that was not sampled. A more gradual decrease in signals occurs at Sites 527, 528, and 529, where more closely spaced samples were analyzed. The gradual decrease in δ[^13]C values above the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary is related to the progressive decrease of the proportion of deposited Cretaceous species in the sample. The decrease in the δ[^13]C signal across the boundary is interpreted as a decrease in primary productivity. Evaluation of the shift of δ[^13]C values in relation to the proportion of redeposited species in early Tertiary samples at Sites 527 and 529 indicates that Cretaceous species did not survived into the Paleocene. Diversity calculated using the Shannon-Weaver equation decreased by 1.8 at Site 525A which is the shallowest location. The average decrease at Sites 527, 528, and 529 was 1.1. These decreases reflect the massive plankton extinctions at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. The carbon isotope and diversity curves correlate across the Cretaceous-Tertiary transition. Diversity recovered in approximately 1.6 m.y.; however, the δ[^13]C signal recovered only some 5 m.y. after the boundary event and, thus lagged biotic recovery by a significant length of time. The paleontological record at the four Walvis Ridge sites indicates that the nannoflora does not record any significant stress or event preceding the massive extinction at the boundary, where the calcareous nannoplankton show an almost total and instant extinction...","Ph.

The study emphasized the effect on cooling load. Three room-sized buildings were used in the field experiment. All buildings were identical in size, color, orientation, and openings. One building was externally insulated, one was internally insulated, and one was uninsulated. The experiment was conducted in the hot-arid climate of Saudi Arabia. Descriptive, inferential, and implication analyses were compared. The descriptive analyses included the black globe temperature (BGT) daily profile plot. The inferential analyses included general linear model (GLM) procedures and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) pairwise comparisons of the BGT means, maximums, minimums, and ranges. The results of BGT analyses were used in an energy simulation program to assess the implications of the results on annual energy consumption and on the sizing of HVAC systems. Results from these analyses indicated significant differences in the average of maximums, ranges, and overall means of the BGT among the three buildings. There were no significant differences at the 95% confidence level in the average of minimums among the three buildings. Findings strongly support the first three hypotheses which were about the BGT means, maximums, and ranges. The implications of the BGT results were found to be within expectations. The annual energy consumption and the size of HVAC equipment were the lowest in the externally insulated house. The cost benefit analysis indicated substantial savings for households; the simple payback period was less than three years. Some of the design recommendations for building in hot-arid climates emphasized the protection of external insulation from impact forces and other environmental effects such as ultraviolet rays. External insulation should be used in buildings with continuous use and continuous air conditioning. More thermal benefits may be attained when external insulation is utilized with night ventilation, although the ventilation aspects had not been studied conclusively here.","Ph.

Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide were used as probe molecules to observe the effects of reduction and metal promoters (i.e., potassium and copper) on iron adsorption sites. The resulting frequencies of the adsorbed molecules were correlated with the types of sites on the surface, and the nature of probe interaction with the surface. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were complementary methods used to establish the extent of reduction and the valence state of iron after calcination and reduction treatments. Calcination (300°C) of silica-supported iron catalysts generates Fe[^2+] sites, whether or not the catalyst is heat-treated in vacuum or cooled in oxygen. High-temperature (730°C) heat-treatment in vacuum forms a surface-reduced phase which generates cationic sites similar to those found on silica-influenced Fe3O4, in addition to non-interacting iron oxide. Reduction generates Fe[^0] sites, but overall reduction is incomplete. NO adsorption on metallic iron occurs associatively and dissociatively, oxidizing Fe[^0]. Subsequent NO adsorption generates bands associated with dinitrosyl species and a bent mononitrosyl species on low-coordination sites. CO adsorbs on calcined, unpromoted catalysts and reacts with surface oxygen to form carbonates. On reduced catalysts, CO adsorbs as a monocarbonyl on Fe[^0] sites and also dissociatively adsorbs, inhibiting NO adsorption on metallic iron, and blocking NO adsorption on high-coordination oxide sites. CO dissociation appears to be dependent on CO pressure and is inhibited by the presence of copper. Copper increases the extent of iron reduction in hydrogen. The amount of metal dispersion increases with copper content. Bulk reduction is about the same as that of the unpromoted silica-supported catalyst. Copper modifies NO adsorption on calcined and reduced catalysts. Potassium provides electron density to iron nitrosyl species associated with Fe[^2+] sites, causing frequency decreases from those which occur on the unpromoted catalyst. Potassium inhibits the formation of Fe[^0]  sites on the surface, but does not inhibit bulk reduction. Potassium decreases the extent of NO adsorption, poisoning high-coordination sites, but permitting NO adsorption on low-coordination sites.","Ph.

The presence of such constraints causes the closed-loop DMC system to behave nonlinearly even if the plant dynamics axe linear. Consequently, well known linear control theory is not sufficient to analyze the stability properties of such a system. The analysis is even further complicated by the facts that no analytic expression is available for the DMC controller and uncertainty always exists in the process model. Present design techniques of DMC controllers rely on experience or ad hoc solutions, without closed-loop stability guarantees. Widespread usage of DMC controllers in industry makes the development of a controller design theory a formidable problem whose solution is of great practical importance. In this work, we provide a theory which utilizes the basic dynamic programming principles to analyze and design DMC controllers in the presence of disturbances, process input/output constraints, and modeling error. The key point of the theory is the modification of the classical DMC formulation by including an extra constraint which we called end-condition.

Moench) is often considered a viable potential resource. Plant breeding efforts to improve sorghum are limited in part by a poor definition of quality traits and their inheritance. To address these concerns, six diverse sorghums were compared and then combined to produce a full F(,1) diallel with reciprocal crosses for genetic analysis. Fourteen agronomic, composition or quality traits were measured using chemical, biological and microscopic techniques. The six parental genotypes were grown at College Station and Weslaco, Texas in 1982 and 1983 while the diallel was grown at College Station in 1983. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, correlation and the Jinks-Hayman methods of diallel analysis. A significant genotype x environment interaction occurred for Brix % and yield per plant, but height and maturity did not display a significant effect. Among the traits evaluated, Brix % and total sugars were highly positively correlated and total sugars and cell wall % were highly negatively correlated. Structural components, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose comprised between 50 to 65% of the total carbohydrate and as such indicate that utilization schemes must use these fractions. IVDMD was not highly correlated with any of the traits evaluated nor did the microscope measurements correlate in a useful manner. Through the diallel analysis, it was determined that additive genetic variance was a significant factor for total sugars, cell wall %, IVDMD, hemicellulose and starch. However, partial dominance was indicated for several traits as well. Reciprocal effects were not a major factor for the traits evaluated. Heritability estimates ranged from a high of 88% for starch to almost zero for lignin; with total sugars, IVDMD and starch being the only traits with heritabilities greater than 35%.

This approach uses various information measures based on entropy to define the limits of predictability and to quantify the information given by different climate components and boundary forcings about the prediction of future climate anomalies. Together with a set of basis functions defined through frequency dependent empirical orthogonal functions, this method provides a systematic way of studying the regional predictability of a complex system. The method is applied to study predictability of the atmosphere simulated by the NCAR CCM0 on a zonally symmetric land planet. By removing the ocean in the simulation, the time scale of the system has been greatly reduced. Hence, this simulation provides sufficient time samples for realistic study of the properties of the atmospheric component. Atmospheric variability as simulated under the various idealized boundary conditions is studied. This provides noise climatologies useful for climate sensitivity experiments. The space-time statistics of the simulated surface temperature field are fitted satisfactorily by a stochastic climate model with only five parameters. This suggests the usefulness of simple statistical models as guidance for climate sensitivity studies, and sampling considerations for model simulation or data collection. The limit of predictability of the first kind of the surface temperature field is found over two zonal bands: tropics (0°-20°) and mid-latitudes (40°-60°). The predictability as a function of spherical harmonic degree is also evaluated. Results are consistent with past studies of atmospheric predictability using random perturbation experiments. Extension of the above study to climate predictability of the second kind is discussed.","Ph.

Two pedons were described at each sublocation. Phosphate rates (0, 25, 50, and 75 mg P kg^-1) and sources (triple superphosphate, TSP; dicalcium phosphate, DCP; and tricalcium phosphate, TCP) were evaluated in pots for rice (Oryza sativa L ) in Cameroon. Rice yields at varying rates of P using reagent grade monocalcium phosphate on soils of the Mbo Plain and two soils from the gulf coast of Texas was determined in the greenhouse at College Station. Phosphate fractionation and sorption isotherms were evaluated to determine P requirements of rice. Properties of the Mbo Plain soils were similar in all sublocations. The texture alternated between clay and clay loam. Base saturation was low and ranged from 4 to 52%. Soils are acidic with a water pH range of 3.8 to 5.0. Aluminum saturation percentage varied from 16 to 92%. Clay mineralogy was kaolinitic and ECEC ranged from 2.3 to 11.4 cmol kg^-1. Two taxonomic orders were identified.

Preliminary studies suggested that one agrichemical or diluent can improve, have no effect, or decrease insecticidal activity compared with another diluent or agrichemical. This study investigated the effects of selected oil diluents (mineral, cottonseed and soybean) and foliar nitrogen fertilizers (urea and triazone) on the efficacy of λ-cyhalothrin against Heliothis virescens (F.) larvae. The mortality of third instar H. virescens was higher on leaf-discs when λ-cyhalothrin was applied ultra low volume (ULV) in mineral oil than when the pyrethroid was applied in cottonseed or soybean oil with a controlled droplet applicator. Larval mortality was lowest when λ-cyhalothrin was conventionally applied in water through hydraulic, hollow cone nozzles. Behavior of third instar H. virescens was observed on plants sprayed with λ-cyhalothrin in a water or mineral oil diluent. Differences in behavioral responses to λ-cyhalothrin treated plants were quite evident between the diluents. Both λ-cyhalothrin treatments reduced larval feeding on squares compared with untreated plants. The mineral oil + λ-cyhalothrin residues caused larvae to remain stationary on the leaf surface or actually abandon the treated plant surface compared with λ-cyhalothrin in water where larvae continued to move about the leaf surface and feed on the squares. Lambda-cyhalothrin was more disruptive to normal behavior when applied in mineral compared with water. Spray residues of mineral oil alone caused very little change in larval behavior when compared with behavior on untreated plants. In a field experiment, λ-cyhalothrin was sprayed on fruiting cotton plants in mineral oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, and water diluents. There was an overall nonsignificant trend for λ-cyhalothrin applied in mineral oil to provide the highest control of H. virescens larval numbers and the lowest larval damage to the cotton compared with λ-cyhalothrin applied in cottonseed oil, soybean oil, or water. Lambda-cyhalothrin applied in water gave the lowest control. In spray chamber experiments with mixtures of foliar nitrogen fertilizers and λ-cyhalothrin, larval mortality on leaf discs was highest when λ-cyhalothrin was applied in a spray containing triazone.

However, the first pass leading and the second pass trailing surfaces show a decrease in heat transfer coefficient in rotation.  The model orientation of the coolant channel has significant effect on the secondary flow and heat transfer pattern.  Ribs placed oblique to the bulk flow generate secondary flows of their own.

GC-MS, HRMS and MS-MS are well-established as powerful and versatile tools for identifying components of organic mixtures. Many improvements have been incorporated in order to provide the maximum amount of information that can be derived from the mass spectrometry methodologies. Each element of the analytical scheme is applied to complex samples of aqueous organic materials extracted from heavy oil retorts. The project focuses on development of methods rather than acquisition of compositional data; therefore, emphasis is placed on data which most clearly illustrate the utility and limitations of a given method. Criteria is developed to evaluate the informational content of the mass spectrometric methods. The elements of the scheme provide different perspectives on components in a highly complex sample. Each methodology supplies specific data not obtainable from other methods. GC-MS serves as an excellent survey analysis, and when combined with selective ion monitoring and the library search program, isolates specific groups of compounds without extensive sample treatment. MS-MS and the library search program are used to extract structural information. HRMS is used to determine elemental composition of mass resolved ions. PBM assists in structure elucidation by providing state-of-the-art library retrieval capabilities.

Descriptive statistics were used for reporting the personal and situational characteristics of the respondents. Relationships among these characteristics were determined using crosstabulations with chi square and Cramer's V statistics. Reasons for enrollment, for joining the FFA or not joining the FFA, and perceptions of SAEP were determined by factor analyzing items in the survey instrument. Relationships among selected personal and situational characteristics and respondents' reasons for enrolling, reasons for joining or not joining the FFA, and perceptions of SAEP were determined by analysis of variance.

An optimum doping density, anneal temperature and time for maximum sensitization has been determined. With an implantation dose of 10(exponent_15) ions cm(exponent_-2) the light-to-dark current ratio is 50 times that of an unimplanted sample for an illumination level of 75 foot-candles. Damage which resulted due to implantation is studied with Scanning Electron Microscopy. The observed dark spots are interpreted as small interstitial clusters or unresolvable interstitial dislocation loops produced by displacement cascades from the bombarding ions. Observed superlinearity of photo current with light intensity is supported with a theoretical calculation based on a two-state model. Theoretical calculations are made from both closed form and numerical analytical approaches. Spectral response curves are interpreted in terms of volume and surface excitation of photo-carriers. In addition it is noted that the threshold for the absorption edge can be varied and the longer wavelength spectral response can be broadened with implantation dose. Variation of time constants with doping densities and light intensity is experimentally determined and theoretically analyzed. Moreover, their wavelength dependence is noted. A linear trap distribution profile affecting the response time characteristics is observed.","Ph. D","Doctorial","Electrical Engineering","Major electrical engineering","","","","McCulley, W.

Some problems have been created by the shift in preferred treatment locations from institutions to community-based residences. Individuals served in the institutions must acquire the interpersonal skills necessary to succeed in community-based service settings. One of the prevailing mental illnesses of clients in institutions is autism (autistic disorder or pervasive developmental disorder). Due to the presenting problems of autism (language deficiencies, withdrawal from others, and obsessive desires for sameness) coupled with extremely low intelligence because of mental retardation, specific training strategies must be identified and implemented for deinstitutionalization to continue. The purpose of this study was to develop a training sequence which would assist the direct care workers at state institutions to provide more effective direct training to the clients. The training sequence was designed to instruct the direct care staff to: (1) Identify the severe deficiencies related to autism. (2) Identity instructional strategies which will compensate for the deficiencies of autism. (3) Model effective teaching strategies. The training sequence was field tested at Brenham State School, Fannin Unit, Brenham, Texas. The subjects in the field test were direct care workers on Fannin Unit.

Leprecaun were studied in a series of greenhouse experiments. Plants were fertilized with fullstrength Hoagland's nutrient solution containing 0,2.5, and 10 mM K (K1? K2 , and K3 , respectively). Root longevity was determined by the percentage of post-drought stress live-roots (PLR), using 8 6 Rb+ labeling. Total, shoot, root and leaf dry weight increased; while root:shoot ratio, and leaf area ratio of both drought-stressed and non-drought stressed plants decreased from Kj to K2 , respectively. Regardless of drought treatment, leaf area was always greatest in K3 plants, and drought stress reduced SLA of K2 and K3 plants. Thus at higher K, the transpiring surface area of the leaves was reduced relative to the photosynthetic mesophyll volume. High K (2.5 to 3.0% leaf K) increased the PLR under drought conditions (-1.5 MPa VPL). At K2 and K3, plants had higher relative water content (RWC), compared to Kj plants. Leaf Ca and Mg concentration decreased at K levels above 2.5 to 3.0%. At peak drought, photosynthesis (A) was highest in K2 plants, whereas transpiration (E) was lowest in K3 plants. WUE,- decreased as 'P l was reduced by drought stress from -0.5 MPa to -1.5 Mpa. Leaf osmotic potential ('FJC) was highest (less negative) and turgor potential ('Pp) was lowest in Kj plants. Drought-stressed plants had lower A compared to non-drought stressed plants at all K levels except for K2 in experiment 2. At peak drought, A was lower at K3, despite higher A in K2 plants.

Major research findings for the study indicated: (1) Administrators and researchers are expecting the middle school science and mathematics classes in Texas in the next century to be based on promoting interdisciplinary and thematic hands-on problem solving activities involving process skills in a real world context and application for all students. (2) The participants in the study expect the focus to be on topics that offer positive, exciting, and realistic science/mathematics experiences with the use of state of the art calculators, computers, and other technology in all aspects of the curriculum. (3) Analysis of central tendency, variance, and correlation indicate a close correlation of agreement between the responses of both groups of professionals. The research supports the premise that administrators appear to be prepared to implement reforms in science and mathematics education which will help Texas school children.

The child development literature suggests a differential educational experience among young African males when compared to their peers. The researcher's intent was to examine selected psychosocial variables to determine any relationship which might exist between the variables and academic achievement. Major questions were 1) whether there exists a relationship between academic achievement and the way the young African American males feel about and perceive themselves, their attitude toward school, and their family environment, 2) which of the self-esteem, self-perception and attitude toward school variables and which of the family environment variables are the best predictors of academic achievement, and 3) whether there exists differences in achievement based on selected demographic characteristics. Subjects for the study were 61 African American males enrolled in the fourth and fifth grades from four elementary schools in the southeast. The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills mean scores and summed grade point averages in reading, mathematics, and science were used as measures of achievement. The Hare Self-Esteem Scale and the Self-Perception Profile for Children served as measures of the way the young males felt about and perceived themselves. The Quality of School Life Scale was used to assess attitude toward school. The Family Environment Scale served as a measure of the ""family climate"" and a researcher questionnaire was used to obtain selected demographic information. Results of the study indicated that the following variables were significantly related to academic achievement: peer, home, school, and general self-esteem, scholastic competence, global self-worth, commitment to classwork, intellectual-cultural orientation and achievement orientation.

In the two sample problem, it is desired to test the null hypothesis that two independent random samples have a common distribution function. Assuming certain conditions on the distribution functions, a procedure is proposed which has strong graphical elements, a sound theoretical foundation, and estimates the relation of the two distributions if the null hypothesis is rejected. The proposed procedure has as its motivation the estimation of the comparison density and inference concerning its uniformity. The proposed procedure is both a statistical test of the null hypothesis and a model selection criterion. The test is based on components of a new stochastic process which is termed the kernel density process. This process is based on a boundary kernel estimate of the comparison density. It is proposed to apply a new test, the subset chi-square test, to these components. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the components found to be significant are used to construct a damped orthogonal series estimate of the comparison density. The power of the proposed test under local alternatives is compared to two commonly used portmanteau statistics, the Cramer-von Mises and the Anderson-Darling, and to a third statistic suggested by this work. A new method for finding the power of these statistics under local alternatives is given. This method uses the fast Fourier transform to invert an approximation to the characteristic function of the statistic. The proposed test is seen to have good power properties.

This study was conducted during a ten-week intensive English language summer program.  The data was collected with foreign students and ESL teachers teaching an intermediate composition class (200 level), an intermediate grammar class (200 level) and an advanced listening class (300 level) in an English Language Institute in the United States.  Initial and final interviews with new and returning foreign students were conducted.  The data also included interviews with key personnel, and classroom observations (included videotaping). Additional data regarding assessment was provided by both the new and returning students and the key personnel.  The data was sorted, resorted, categorized and analyzed to determine the factors that affected English as a second language learning for the particular group of participants involved in the study. The findings of this study suggest that second language (English) learners believe that there are a number of factors and difficulties that have a negative or positive effect as to how and why people learn a second language: age; attitude/behavior; aptitude; exposure to formal and informal instruction; immersion into the target language, culture, and environment; background experiences; personality and willingness to take risks; travelling experiences; comparability between the native/first or second language and the target language; feelings and expectations; external helpers; strategies to deal with target language speakers in real life situations; interactions with target language speakers; degree of oral language proficiency; target language speakers' attitudes toward second language learners; long term goals and learners' motivation for learning the target language; cognitive strategies to improve target language skills; and socio-cultural issues.

The reaction of two equivalents of Na(Hg) with Cr2Cl6(dmpm)2 yields Cr2Cl4(dmpm)2 in which we expected to find multiple Cr-Cr bonds. However, the dichromium(II) compound, Cr2Cl4 (dmpm)2, avoids any Cr-Cr bond formation by adopting a bizarre structure. Cr2Cl4(dmpm)2 reacts with methanol to yield Cr2Cl4(/Li-OMe)2(dmpm)2.

The current matrix elements which occur in the the calculation are generated directly in the frame where they are needed, rather than using a previous approach of generating them in the Breit frame and boosting them.

The method is used to predict proton-proton pair production for scattering, which is of fundamental interest as a basic mechanism for any nucleus-nucleus collision.

Objectives were to: I) determine relationships among landscape use, grouping and abundance across sites, 2) characterize variation in grouping associated with rainfall patterns in the brushland and grassland ecoregions of the study area, and 3) explore which landscape measures best explained within site variation in grouping, considering 3 spatial scales (mesohabitat, territory, home range). Although abundance was higher (17.1 ± 4.1 hawks/100km) than reported for more arid regions, observations of groups (>2 hawks) varied across sites (0.113 ± 0.037 groups/observation). Groups were not observed at 3 of 4 sites in the wetter, eastern grassland, where abundance was slightly lower than brushland. One grassland site with abundant hawks and groups was a drier, habitat fragment in a landscape devoid o f woody vegetation. Abundance correlated with grouping but not with the landscape variables measured. However, hawks were typically found in areas with less fragmented woody vegetation. Vegetation strata differed between random points and hawk locations at 5 sites, four of which had groups, but differences could not be generalized across sites. Sightings of 3 hawks were more likely to be at brushland than grassland locations (z = 2.34, p < 0.05). Larger groups (4-5 hawks) and groups with young-of-the-year were sighted infrequently with no differences between ecoregions. Two indices of grouping were significantly negatively correlated with rainfall recorded near each site in the same year, but not with indices o f rainfall during the previous year. Only subtle differences in landscape vegetation were found between areas around grouped and non-grouped Harris' hawk locations. I compared vegetation patterns at three ecologically appropriate scales. The greatest differences were observed at the finest scale (simulating mesohabitat), leading to hypotheses related to prey availability for this group-hunting predator and distribution of scarce resources (e.g., water). Results were interpreted relative to the Ecological Constraints Model predicting groups in harsh environments. To refine testable predictions from this model, I recommend using spatially explicit landscape measures to document distribution of resources relative to groups.","Ph.

In the ANCOVAs the pre-test was the covariate. Cell means on pre-tests, post-tests, gains, percent gains, time to complete the program, student preference of computers, group functioning, and student perceptions of group functioning were studied.

Results indicated when the pre-test was used as the covariate, group size did not affect the post-test. The effects of ethnicity, gender, and age did not produce significant differences with group size. Since no significant differences were found, the large group treatment is warranted in terms of achievement. In terms of satisfaction, however, students stated a preference for small groups. Group functioning when combined with cooperative learning principles for IVI provided more interactions in small groups and promoted positive student interactions in small and large groups.

Nevertheless, Ingersoll (1977b) and Mikkelson (1985) report that managers tend to delay calling their firm's convertible securities until conversion value is well in excess of call price. I investigate two explanations of delayed calls of convertible preferred stock. First, Jaffee and Shleifer's (1990) call failure hypothesis states that managers delay calls to assure forced conversion. When a firm must give advance notice of a call, conversion value can fall below call price during the notice period. In this case, the call fails and the firm must quickly raise cash to pay the call price. Delaying calls ""guarantees"" forced conversion and avoids the costs of call failure. I test whether factors that increase the probability of call failure can explain excess conversion values on call announcement dates. I find very little support for the call failure hypothesis. Next, I test the Dunn and Eades' (1989) passive investor hypothesis. According to the passive investor model, firms do not follow the perfect market call policy because some investors rationally deviate from the perfect market voluntary conversion strategy. Investors who do not convert to receive large common dividends create cash flow savings for the firm. These savings can be had only if the firm delays calling. Tests offer weak support for the passive investor model. I show that convertible preferred stock often is priced less than conversion value, but not when the passive investor model predicts. I also find positive, but insignificant, cash flow benefits for firms that delay calls. Finally, I find that preferred stock that should be converted has less systematic risk than common stock.","Ph.

The plastochron index was delayed at 80 mM salt, but was relatively unchanged in the 40 mM salt treatment This may indicate a change in the developmental physiology of the plant at higher salt levels. Root osmotic potential decreased within thirty minutes after salt shock and remained lower than the control for at least 24 hours. The plants wilted and regained turgor within the first six hours. Root invertase activity increased after six hours in 80 mM NaCl and remained higher than the control for at least seven days. Because the invertase did not increase until six hours after salt shock, it may not be involved in the initial recovery of turgor. However, it may play a role in long term osmotic adjustment. The transport sugars sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose decreased on days 1, 3, and 5 after NaCl shock. Myo-inositol, galactose, glucose, and fructose increased on day 3 then dropped to levels similar to the controls. Melibiose increased over time, perhaps as an indication of root injury or senescence. Reducing sugars may play a role in osmotic adjustment at salt levels less than those used in this study. Elemental analysis showed that Na+ concentrations increased dramatically in the roots within 24 hours while the Ca[^2+], Mg[^2+], and K+ concentrations decreased...","Ph.

To understand the biological significance of the maintenance of specific base differences in the 3' 200 nucleotides of the three genomic RNAs, all possible permutations were used to exchange these regions among the genomic RNAs. When all RNAs bore the 3' end of RNA-1, the total RNA accumulation was only 15% of wild-type; when the 3' end of RNAs -2 or -3 was present on all three RNAs, the total RNA accumulation was reduced to 30 or 35% of wild-type. Two major processes were found to be involved in these dramatic differences. The first reflects the distinct and competitive strengths of the (-)-strand promoters in these sequences. The second is the importance of the context of upstream sequences in which the 3' promoter is placed. The transfer of previously constructed mutations to the 3' end of RNA-1 helped in understanding the role in BMV RNA replication of RNA-1 and the la protein encoded by it. The debilitating effect on replication of aminoacylation defective mutations when present on RNAs -1 and -2 suggests a role for aminoacylation in the replication of RNAs encoding replication-essential proteins. To understand the reason(s) behind the persistence of base differences among the three genomic RNAs and the impairing effect on replication of mutations in the 3' end, RNA-protein binding techniques were developed. Contaminating coat protein in the BMV replicase extract was found to interact specifically with two domains of RNA-1. A mutant of coat protein (lacking the first 25 amino acids) that was previously found to be defective in encapsidation was found to be incapable of binding RNAs in vitro. On the other hand, the wild-type coat protein was found to bind RNAs in a cooperative manner, which is believed to be the mechanism responsible for rapid encapsidation in vivo.","Ph.

Method development. A method to determine PAH metabolites in fish by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was developed. Biliary metabolites were recovered by enzymatic and acidic hydrolysis. TMS-ethers of PAH metabolites were analyzed by GC/MS, the derivatization of metabolites with bis (trimethylsilylfluoro) acetamide enhanced GC/MS. Time-course response of PAH metabolites in fish. Antarctic fish (Notothenial gibberifrons) adminstered 100 $\mu$l Diesel Fuel Arctic by intramuscular injection responded rapidly with elevated PAH metabolites within 24 hours of exposure. Production of PAH metabolites was generally proportional to exposure time. The findings suggest the presence of a positive metabolite response mechanism in fish capable of rapid response to PAH exposure. Field study. Elevated concentrations of PAH metabolites correlated positively with fish neoplasm. No correlation was found between PAH concentrations in local sediments and fish neoplasms. PAH metabolites have been indentified in all three species of fish collected near the Apex barge oil spill in Galveston Bay. The total PAH metabolite concentrations were high in fish collected one week after the spill and decreased significantly four and sixteen weeks after the spill. This finding, and similar TIC patterns of PAH metabolites and PAH in Apex oil, suggests that the fish were exposed to the Apex oil.","Ph.

The proposed tests can be applied to test for any kind of change, whether it be abrupt or smooth. Nonparametric function estimation techniques are used in deriving these tests. The test statistics utilize a Fourier series smoother that minimizes an estimate of mean integrated squared error.  Estimating the underlying function is greatly complicated when the data are correlated. An important example of correlated data is that arising from a stationary time series. To obtain a valid test of mean constancy, it is necessary to estimate the spectrum of the error process. We consider various methods of estimating the error spectrum. We have found that, in the case of an AR(1) model, the spectrum is well-estimated if local linear smoothing is used in conjunction with generalized least squares.  A power study of the proposed tests is done by simulation when the errors follow an AR(1) model, and the tests are applied to a set of astronomy data.","Ph.

Such deep water records and their spectra are desirable as a means of characterizing the tsunami source.

While not of the same trapping capacity as the Hawaiian Island or continents, Wake Island and its neighboring sea mounts can produce quasi-resonant responses for periods near 3, 5, 6, 9 and 14 minutes. This effect sufficiently distorts the signals near shore, at the Van Dorn wave gauge and at a tide well within the lagoon, that they are quite different from that in the deep water. An inverse method is discussed by which the deep water signal can be estimated by one gauge and checked by the other. This inverse method is employed to determine an estimate of the deep sea tsunami signal from the Van Dorn gauge. Unfortunately the independent check using the tide gauge was not possible because of the lack of reliable information on its dynamic response characteristics at periods in the spectral band for the tsunami event.","Ph.

The polydnavirus which occurs in the reproductive tract of C. sonorensis (CsV) has several effects on the host independent of the presence of parasitoid eggs or larvae. The present study found that CsV disrupted the development of last-instar H. virescens larvae by suppressing host ecdysteroid titers. When injected in large doses, CsV caused total degeneration of the glands which was associated with the permanent suppression of host hemolymph ecdysteroid titers. Total gland degeneration, therefore, prevented pupation by the host. When host larvae were injected with lower doses, however, a dose-dependent proportion exhibited only partial degeneration of the prothoracic glands. These hosts were delayed in development and remained in the stage in which they were injected due to a dose-dependent period of suppressed ecdysteroid titers. After the period of suppression, ecdysteroid titers rose to normal levels and host development continued normally. CsV had little, if any, effect on surviving prothoracic gland cells. The number of surviving gland cells per larva was inversely related to both the mean size of the cells and the length of development by the larva after injection. Intact cells apparently compensated for the lost ecdysone production of degenerated cells. However, there seemed to be a maximum rate of production by intact cells, so that fewer cells took longer to elevate the host's ecdysteroid titers to normal levels.","Ph.

Sequential measurements in manufacturing systems and on-line measured signals in speech recognition systems can be well described by nonstationary models (e.g. piece-wise or quasi-stationary models). Multiple models are used for describing a nonstationary process behavior which may randomly switch from one model to another within a set of stationary models. The model orders and parameter values of the members are known initially and they are expanded by on-line model identification. Two novel methods are employed in the design of the proposed hybrid learning procedure: an adaptive segmentation algorithm and an adaptive neural network. The first method is developed for detecting a change in the underlying process model, while the second performs on-line model identification of the changed process. The design of the adaptive hybrid system consists of the following four components: (i) a bank of parallel filters (prediction neural sub-networks) constructed from multiple models, (ii) a model classification neural network, (iii) a sequential model change detection procedure based on an adaptive segmentation algorithm and (iv) the recursive least squares parameter estimation method. The objective of this research is to design an adaptive signal processing system for sequential monitoring of a quasi-stationary process; the primary concern is to detect the time of a change and to perform on-line model adaptation. Two significant contributions are provided: a development of a sensitive change detection procedure and a design of an efficient modular neural network for on-line processing of nonlinear and nonstationary time series. The proposed adaptive hybrid system may be thought of as an extension of the conventional multi-model approach. Here nonlinearity and nonstationarity axe approximated by quasi-stationary piece-wise linear, or piece-wise nonlinear models. Experimental results show that the proposed neural network approach is capable as an on-line learning system with a sensitive detection response in nonstationary environments. A manufacturing process change behavior can be effectively captured by the proposed on-line learning hybrid system.","Ph.

However, the availability of new molecular and biochemical tools including cDNAs and antipeptide antibodies permits extensive characterization of gap junctions. A myometrial cell culture system was developed for study of regulatory mechanisms governing gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). Primary myometrial cells, isolated by progressive enzymatic digestion of the uterine tissue were used to establish cell lines by serial passage and transfection with a pSV3neo plasmid. Steroid hormone assays by radioligand-hormone competition indicated that estrogen receptors were decreased in cell lines compared to primary cells. This limited the utility of cell lines. Primary cultures also expressed high levels of progesterone receptors. The smooth muscle origin of the cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence labelling for desmin, α-smooth muscle actin and myosin. Staining with antibody to α-gap junction protein confirmed the presence of connexin43 in these cultures. Functional and structural characterizations of GJIC were assayed by electron microscopy and a fluorescent recovery after photobleaching assay, gap FRAP. Contrary to the insitu uterus, cultured myometrial cells spontaneously formed gap junctions. Further, estradiol (10^-7M) increased GJIC, while progesterone only suppressed estradiol induced increases. Indomethacin treatment indicated that prostaglandins increased GJIC. In vivo, cAMP and its analogs decrease myometrial GJIC, in contrast, increases in GJIC was observed in cultured myometrial cells. Using a paradigm in which octanol was used to reduce GJIC to low levels, application of cAMP and its anologs caused rapid increases in GJIC. Similar results were obtained with SIGC and Clone 9 cells which also express connexin43. The rapidity of modulation by cAMP, within minutes, suggests gating of channels by phosphorylation. TPA induced protein kinase C was inhibitory on GJIC. An antipeptide antibody to a sequence of a-gap junction protein was produced, but proved ineffective for immunofluorescence..","Ph.

Reviewing the current educational engineering software, two major deficiencies surfaced: (1) a method for integration into the classroom was not identified and (2) an instructional model was not used in the development process. This indicated a clear need for a science-based design approach founded upon the cognitive sciences and educational research. In taking the science-based approach, the organization of knowledge and use of different learning styles are identified as two important factors that affect the students' learning and hence the design of the ITS. Input from the faculty to identify key problem areas in classroom learning of engineering science courses was obtained through a survey. These results were used in developing an instructional model for the tutoring module. Fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, and vibration courses were examined for commonalities and differences in approach and a knowledge structure developed for each. These were then generalized to form a basis for the knowledge base. A simple yet effective student model is proposed. This strategy forms a basis for the proposed ITS design. The system design was implemented using LUCID's Symbolic Programming Environment which is an integrated package including LISP, flavors, and a window toolkit. The framework implementation was demonstrated on two fluid mechanics examples and one solid mechanics example. The issues addressed include supplementary needs of the engineering science classroom, hardware and software concerns, identification of key attributes adequate to define a problem, choice of knowledge representation scheme(s), development of an educationally-based tutoring strategy, and implementation issues such as the formalization of the problem solving process. In conclusion, the framework is a viable means of providing supplementary tutoring for the engineering science courses.

Because virtually every aspect of the economy was controlled by the government during those years, its trade and development policies have been credited with creating both the greatest industrial expansion and the worst economic crisis in its history. The methodology employed to assess the structural changes in manufacturing is based on the transcendental logarithmic production function which explicitly measures the marginal productivities and elasticities of output with respect to labor, capital and material inputs. In addition, this methodology provides an empirical measure of total factor productivity (TFP), or increase in output not accounted for by increases in factor inputs. The results indicate that TFP contributed negatively to the production process, declining 1.02 percent while growth in output was in excess of 31 percent. The marginal productivity and contribution of capital declined 6.15 percent and 12.12 percent, respectively, more the result of a decline in capital return than from reduced investment. The contribution of labor declined 2.57 percent owing to a 29.75 percent reduction in real wages, as employment grew 55.96 percent. Increases in the prices of material inputs caused its share in the value of output to increase 5.56 percent while the marginal productivity grew a modest 0.12 percent. Trade orientation had no detectable effect on TFP due to relatively insignificant changes in trade performance. Exports grew in real terms but remained a small part of total output (5.3 percent in 1985). Import substitution grew 22.0 percent but imports accounted for only 7.8 percent of domestic use in 1985. Government trade and development programs were primarily responsible for the over-all decline in productivity but not for the variations in TFP among the sectors. Efforts to promote productivity though control of technology transfer, investment, ownership, and financial incentives proved ineffective against extensive protectionist measures and currency controls. These actions provided an anti-export bias and a disincentive to investment in technology.","Ph.

The National Guard was a force, although partially equipped and trained, that could augment it. The Army quickly won presidential approval to increase both the Guard's size and its training, but not to the levels the Army wished. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was hesitant to take too large a step for the largely isolationist populist. The Army, too, moved cautiously in its efforts to train and reorganize the National Guard. The National Guard Association represented the Guard's officer corps and possessed one of the most effective lobbies at that time. It had long sought an increased national defense and funds without incurring substantial Federal control. From 1939 through 1941, the Association, at the behest of Milton A. Reckord, its able lobbyist, set aside its concerns over Federal control, if only briefly, and cooperated with the Army, but only if the Federal government paid for more troops and equipment. While the Association attempted to balance its state and national concerns, Congress grappled with the political costs of mobilizing citizen soldiers. Isolationists in particular faced the dilemma of strengthening national defense and restricting the growth of presidential power. Public Law 96 passed in August 1940 provided for the mobilization of the National Guard for one year, but restricted its use to US possessions and the Western Hemisphere. In 1941 Roosevelt requested Congress to retain Guardsmen, Reservists, and draftees. While retention of the Guard was not in serious doubt, it was tied to keeping draftees beyond one year. Passage of retention legislation by one vote denoted the nation's division over the nation's possible evolvement in the war. The Acts of 1940 and 1941 tested the National Guard as an instrument of national defense and expanded the Federal government's powers over the Guard. Federalized units served as training grounds for draftees and effective combat units. Mobilization brought another result. Congress had expanded its power to use the Guard as a Federal reserve force, effectively removing it from the state' hands, a point finally clarified in 1990 by the Supreme Court.","Ph.

Questions also arise about how new regulatory elements are integrated into the complex physiology of new tissues. To examine these questions, the patatin multigene family was used as a model system. Patatin is a family of lipid acyl hydrolases that accounts for 30-40% of the total protein in potato tubers. The Class-I genes, which produce the majority of the patatin protein in tubers, can also be induced to express at high levels in stems and leaves by 0.2 -0.3 M sucrose. However, under normal conditions, they are almost totally tuber-specific. To examine how ""tuber-specific"" genes could have evolved from regulatory elements in non-tuberizing species, the expression of the endogenous patatin genes in tomato and tobacco were compared to that of potato Class-I patatin promoters using transgenic plants. Patatin promoters were also isolated and characterized from tobacco and evolutionarily divergent species of wild potato. These promoters contain sequences characteristic of both the Class-I and Class-II patatin genes. However, their patterns of expression are unlike those of any previously reported patatin genes. They were neither sucrose inducible nor tuber-specific and were wound-inducible, unlike potato Class-I patatin genes which are turned off by wounding. Because the major soybean vegetative storage protein (VSP) serves similar roles in soybeans to that served by patatin in potatoes, vsp promoter expression in transgenic potato plants was also examined. Although vsp is normally expressed in soybean leaves, it was tuber-specific when introduced into potato plants. Like Class-I patatin, vsp could be induced to express in leaves by sucrose, but unlike patatin, vsp could also be induced by methyl jasmonate, systemin and oligourinides...","Ph.

Polyuridylic acid has been selected as the model for this study due to its relatively well characterized radiation chemistry and its similarity to DNA, the critical radiation target of the cell. Free radicals attack the uracil and ribose sugar by forming adducts with the base or by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the sugar moiety. The adducts are called intermediate radicals which will either release a hydrogen molecule or a water molecule to become the original base or they will abstract a hydrogen from the sugar moiety o f an adjacent nucleotide. The abstraction o f a hydrogen from the sugar moiety is assumed to be followed by a strand break and a base release. Only the free radicals *OH, H* and which are produced by radiolysis o f water play important role in causing damage to biomolecules. Previously performed irradiation experiments with DNA model systems, such as poly(U), are simulated in complete detail by a Monte Carlo computer code, namely OREC and RADLYS. OREC is the code for the transport of electrons through water. RADLYS simulates the prechemistry and early chemical stage of electron track development. These codes were modified to simulate the radiolysis of poly(U) in aqueous solution. In this dissertation, detailed discussions are given o f the modifications to the OREC and RADLYS codes for the simulation and the development of poly(U) as a molecular model for radiation damage to biomolecules. The 60Co Gy(E) values for strand break and base release are determined to be 1.77 and 2.00, respectively. If the radius of the cylinder is halved and length increased four times, the corresponding 60Co Gy(E) values are 2.35 and 2.75, respectively. The latter set of data displays a close agreement with those obtained experimentally by von Sonntag (1987). Detailed discussions on the comparisons of the calculational and experimental data are presented in this report. Simulations under other irradiation conditions are also reported.","Ph.

First, to investigate the impact of unequal processing time variances on overall shop performance. Second, to implement strategies for improving job shop performance by designing priority dispatching policies that include measures of system statistical variability. The approach is through a statistical- experiment in which processing time variances, at specified machines, are systematically increased while holding processing means constant. The job shops modeled herein deviate from mainstream research which traditionally assumes that processing times are known prior to the implementation of the priority rules. Instead, this study examines a stochastic environment in which operation processing times are random variables from mutually independent probability distributions. It is assumed that the only information available for jobs waiting for service, are their operation processing time distribution. Hence, the priority dispatching policies examined herein are based solely on means and variances instead of exact information. A capstone of this research is the development of four new priority dispatching policies that include components of system variability. In simulated cases these four rules are compared against five commonly studied dispatching rules. The results indicate that that the four variance inclusive rules perform as well or better than the five traditional dispatching rules, in every criterion measured.","Ph.

The 4 x 2 factorial experiment involved eight duplicated treatments consisting of four levels of weed control and two waterlily cultivars. Treatments included a no-weeding control, 2 manual weeding, 1 and 2 grass carp per 52.5-m^2 experimental pen. Initial and monthly densities of aquatic weed biomass, species composition, number of hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata Royle) turions in soil core samples, and upper surface leaf areas and total number of flowers produced per waterlily plant were measured in each pen until complete weed control occurred in both grass-carp treatments. Generally, biomass of aquatic weeds differed significantly among weed-control treatments. Weed biomass in the manual-weeding treatment was lower than in all others soon after initiation of the experiment; in both grass-carp treatments, weed reduction was evident only after winter. Diversity of weed types was very low during the experiment, and succession occurred with changing seasons. Hydrilla was dominant at the beginning of the experiment and watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) near termination. Hydrilla turions in soil increased in fall, and decreased in spring and summer. The competitive effect of weeds on the growth of waterlilies was clearly seen in the latter part of the experiment, with significantly greater leaf areas in the manual-weeding, 1-carp pen^-1 and 2-carp pen^-1 treatments over the control. Following weed elimination, some grass carp ate waterlilies; whereas, others did not. A systems model was developed to simulate the effect of grazing by grass carp on the dynamics of weed biomass in a shallow water body in south Texas. Fish growth was a function of assimilation and metabolism. The model was parameterized using available information from the literature and results of the field experiment. It predicted that a stocking density of 110[plus or minus]7 grass carp ha^-1 (vegetated) would be required to reduce vegetation to 40% of its maximum biomass in the second summer. Two selected management schemes were simulated to estimate the grass carp density necessary to achieve continuous vegetation control at the 40% level.","Ph.

A theoretical model based on this definition is developed which specifies that resources are made available through the implementation of any or all of five empowerment strategies by agents of empowerment. The validity of these ideas is explored in a study of shelters for battered women. Multiple methods are used to assess manifestation of empowermment strategies and change experienced by residents.

Among primates these phylogenetic conclusions were supported: (1) tarsiers are sister to monkeys and apes, (2) the aye-aye is sister to a group containing all lemurs and lorises, (3) dwarf lemurs are more closely related to other lemurs than to lorises, and (4) the ring-tail lemur is sister to gentle lemurs (Hapalemur) rather than to other members of the genus Lemur. COII was inappropriate for addressing most systematic questions among rodents. In comparisons among orders of mammals, COII supported the monophyly of Chiroptera, in contrast to restricted claims that one suborder of bats is more closely related to primates. Relationships among orders could not be determined with a reasonable degree of confidence. In agreement with previous genetic studies of nuclear gene sequences, COII appeared to be evolving more rapidly in rodents than in artiodactyls. However, this difference was not statistically significant. COII and cytochrome c interact during respiration and both have been found to be evolving very rapidly in higher primates, where the COII gene has presumably undergone a change in conformation. The period of accelerated evolution was found to coincide with the origin of higher primates (monkeys and apes). The cytochrome c gene also underwent a period of rapid evolution during this period. These results suggest coevolution between a mitochondrial (COII) and nuclear (cytochrome c) genetic system.","Ph.

A relatively high cost is associated with obtaining it in 99+% purity. Purification of para xylene requires separation from three close boiling C8 aromatics i.e. m-xylene, o-xylene, and ethylbenzene and subsequent isomerization of the remaining ortho and meta xylene isomers to an equilibrium mixture. The removal of ethylbenzene is another source of complication. To study the effect of acid sites in pentasil-type catalyst on the toluene alkylation, and para xylene selectivity, four catalysts with different cations in the frame work were synthesized. These catalyst were synthesized to have a SiO2/M2O3=70, where M is Al, B, Fe, or La. X-ray diffraction patterns of these catalysts indicated that all of these catalysts have a pentalsil-type structure. The results of temperature programmed desorptions (TPD) of ammonia indicate that A1ZSM-5 and FeZSM-5 have three different acid sites, weak, medium and strong. The TPD of ammonia of BZSM5 and LaZSM-5 showed a fourth type acid site. The effect of temperature, residence time, and feed composition on alkylation of toluene with methanol over these catalysts were studied. The A1ZSM-5 produced a xylene composition comparable to the equilibrium composition. Alkylation of toluene with methanol over BZSM-5, FeZSM-5, and LaZSM-5 produce xylene composition different than the equilibrium one. The LaZSM-5 catalyst produced the highest para xylene selectivity. The para xylene composition in the xylene isomers was as high as 92%. The p-xylene isomerization over A1ZSM-5, and LaZSM catalysts, indicate that the minimization of the isomerization reaction is the cause of the high para selectivity. All of the catalysts used in this investigation showed relatively rapid deactivation. The cause of the catalyst deactivation is the coke formation inside of the catalyst pores.","Ph.

A hierarchical generalization of dynamic models is made by adding more realism and by introducing a distinct overturning-type jump updraft. The basic form of the momentum flux profile displays a striking similarity in the models. Shear in the jump inflow and baroclinic vorticity generation only alter the detailed shape of the momentum flux, but they have significant influences on selecting convective regimes. Based on the 22 and 23 June soundings during COPT81 experiment, a series of simulations are conducted with a two-dimensional version of the non-hydrostatic cloud model. Two distinct mechanisms associated with the generation of convective cells are identified: the cold outflow forcing from decaying cells and the initiation by gravity waves. The role of ice microphysics depends on environmental conditions. For the case of strong convective instability, ice impact is important to the system-scale structure but not essential to the convective-scale dynamics. On the other hand, in the situation of weak convective instability, ice effect is crucial to reproduce the observed storm. There is a profound universality in the vertical flux of line-normal momentum in the simulations. The archetypal model is capable of replicating the shape of the line-normal momentum flux reasonably but underestimates the amplitude. The application of the buoyant-type model considerably improves the momentum-flux prediction. The eddy transport is almost independent of the shear in both the initial and domain-averaged wind profiles. In contrast, in the line-parallel direction the eddy transport behaves largely in a down-gradient sense. The Schneider-Lindzentype formulation fails to represent the line-normal momentum flux but predicts the along-line momentum flux well. An idealized model is constructed to examine the density current in non-conservative fluids and sheared environments. It is shown that the incorporation of a stable stratification enhances the depth and propagation of density currents; the opposite behavior is found in buoyant fluids. In a sheared environment the density current deepens and moves faster if the shear changes from negative to positive.","Ph.

Use of Solricin 235 and Simazine to control cyanobacterial growth in shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) culture ponds was evaluated. Solricin treatment significantly reduced cyanobacterial density (as measured by C-phycoerythrin concentration). Simazine treatment did not reduce cyanobacterial densities. Neither treatment significantly affected physicochemical parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH), nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicate) dynamics, chlorophyll concentrations or shrimp survival and growth. Natural ingestion of diatoms by P. vannamei postlarvae in relation to supplementary feed was evaluated. Diatom genera, cell condition (full and empty), and number were determined in shrimp guts and fecal pellets. For the first time it was demostrated that P. vannamei postlarvae grazed actively on epipelic diatoms, especially before feed was applied to the system. Postlarvae showed selectivity in diatom grazing and utilization, with Nitzschia and Navicula being the principal taxa utilized. The impact of shrimp postlarval culture on the temporal dynamics of planktonic and epipelic diatom assemblages in raceways was evaluated through grazing exclosure studies. Diatom communities were dominated by the epipsammic species Synedraulna, and four epipelic species Navicuia stundlii. Amphora coffeaeformis. Nitzschia socialis, and Nitzschia #1. The four epipelic species were selectively grazed by shrimp postlarvae. Epipelic diatoms may contribute significantly to postlarval shrimp production.

This policy, while supporting U.S. producer prices and incomes at a high level, has caused consumers to pay more for sugar and has reduced the incomes of foreign sugar producers. It has also stimulated domestic sugar production along with development of sugar substitutes such as High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) which contributed to the fall in sugar demand. The quota policy has been criticized by previous economic studies and in the GATT trade negotiations. This study extends previous analyses to look at effects of sugar policy changes from a total sector perspective. The study of potential sugar policy reform was done using a mathematical programming sector model. Substitution between HFCS and sugar in sweetener using industries was explicitly modeled. A baseline scenario was constructed and validated using 1986 data which was then compared to alternative policy runs where: (i) the sugar quota was removed, and (ii) a target price was implemented. Comparisons were made with and without farm program provisions for the other sectoral commodities. The results show differing implications in the sugar industry as compared to the agricultural sector. Quota removal raised the welfare of domestic sugar consumers and foreign sugar producers but resulted in a lower welfare level for domestic sugar producers. Welfare for the rest of the society increases with the removal of the quota only if distortions arising from farm programs are eliminated. In the farm program runs, both the removal of the quota and the imposition of target prices resulted in a lower net social welfare compared to the case with the quota. Acreage substitutions towards other crops result in a social welfare loss because of increased government payments. This result provides an empirical example of the theory of the second best as the costs of other distortions outweigh the sugar gains. However, when farm programs for the other crops are eliminated, quota removal results in an increase in net social benefit.","Ph.

A group of proteins known as heat shock proteins (HSPs) are synthesized in response to heat stress and are thought to enhance cellular thermotolerance. Because gene expression begins at variable developmental stages in post-fertilization embryos, early stage embryos may not synthesize heat shock proteins. The hypothesis states that heat shock proteins are not present in the early embryo, thus embryos are susceptible to hyperthermic conditions. In order to detect heat shock gene transcription in a limited number of embryos at early embryonic stages, we developed a 1-tube polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based protocol that minimized RNA loss and enhanced sensitivity of transcription detection. In this protocol, embryonic gDNA was cleaved between primer sites with DNAase; endogenous RNAases were inhibited with a RNAase inhibitor; and RNA integrity was maintained with E. coli rRNA. Samples were reverse transcribed to form cDNA which was then amplified with PCR. The 1-tube protocol was used to synthesize cDNA from mRNA transcripts which were transcribed from a heat inducible heat shock protein gene from murine embryos. Transcripts from HSP 70.1 were detected during the first four days of gestation in murine embryos. The 1-tube protocol was also used to identify the presence of mRNA transcripts from two bovine genes, HSP 70.1 and 70.4. In these studies, two developmental stages were evaluated in the bovine: prior to the 8 to 16-cell stage (3-5 cells) and at 12-16 cells. Heat shock protein 70.1 transcripts appeared during the 12 to 16-cell stage in both control and heat shocked embryos. Transcription was detected from HSP 70.4 before the 8 to 16-cell stage in both control and heat shocked embryos. However, by the 12 to 16-cell stage, only the control embryos synthesized HSP 70.4 mRNA transcripts. We concluded that the 1-tube protocol was sensitive and allowed detection of both murine and bovine heat shock transcripts during early, thermolabile developmental stages. Detection of HSP 70 transcripts at the earliest stages of development suggests that HSP 70 gene expression may be necessary but was not sufficient to protect embryos from thermal stress.","Ph.

A series of experiments focused on analysis of an unusual nuclear distribution of the oncogene products T-antigen and p53 in an SV40- transformed cell line, DC3. Antibodies to T-antigen and p53 were used in conjunction with morphological and biochemical approaches to explain the nature of these antigens in DC3 cells as compared to COS-1, an established SV40-transformed cell line. Approaches included indirect immunofluorescence, double immunolabelling, cell cycle analysis, confocal microscopy, immunogold electron microscopy, nuclear fractionation, Western blot analysis, and DNA transfection of SV40 genes into both primary granulosa and DC3 cells. The results suggested that the unusual distribution of T-antigen and p53 in DC3 cells appears to be characteristic of interphase and is probably not due to gross structural alterations in either protein. A second series of experiments focused on developing a series of cell lines representative of progressive steps in the multistep process of malignant transformation. Primary granulosa cells and a spontaneously immortalized cell line, SIGC, represented the normal state and an intermediate step in transformation, respectively. Several morphological and functional properties of SIGC were evaluated with respect to those of normal granulosa cells. Cell lines further in the transformation pathway were generated by transfecting SIGC with pSV3neo and from tumor explants of transfected cells from a nude mouse. A dye transfer technique showed that progressive stages of transformation were correlated with a progressive loss of gap junction mediated cell-cell communication. The results of this study suggest that the in vitro transformation model system consisting of several cell lines derived from ovarian granulosa cells may be useful for studies of the fundamental nature of transformation in cell types other than those of fibroblast origin. These studies include using DC3 cells for investigation of novel functions of T-antigen, and SIGC cells for transfection or infection with other oncogenes in order to investigate the impact of their expression on cell-cell communication and other growth properties in an epithelial model system.","Ph.

The model accounts for the formation of paraffins and olefins up to an arbitrary carbon number, and disappearance rates can be calculated from known stoichiometry. Equilibrium adsorption was assumed for CO, CO2, H2, and H2O, and accounts for product and reactant inhibition on rates. There was no significant difference in model results using a steady-state adsorption model and an equilibrium model, but the equilibrium model has the advantage of requiring fewer kinetic parameters. The final model requires 8 constants for Fischer-Tropsch, plus additional constants for water-gas shift kinetics (one in this study). Three types of reactors were considered: gas phase stirred tank and fixed bed (plug flow) reactors, and a stirred tank slurry reactor. The gas phase stirred tank is a simple, well defined reactor used in the model development, while the fixed bed reactor was chosen to represent the common laboratory fixed bed. The slurry reactor is another common laboratory reactor, but the reaction occurs on catalyst in the liquid phase formed by condensing the high molecular weight products of the reaction. Vapor-liquid equilibrium with simultaneous chemical reaction was used to account for the condensation. Non-Schulz-Flory distributions were obtained in the slurry reactor simulations due to olefin readsorption followed by chain growth. Higher concentrations of the high molecular weight olefins in the liquid phase cause the non-Schulz-Flory behavior. The adsorption also gives the trend of decreasing olefin content with carbon number expected from experiment. Both of the gas phase reactors (fixed bed and stirred tank) exhibited nearly classical Schulz-Flory distributions under most conditions. In the fixed bed, conversion increases along the length of the reactor, which leads to changes in selectivity with position. The integral effect of the selectivity profiles causes some carbon number dependence on α and olefin content, but the deviations from classical distributions are significant only at low carbon numbers...","Ph.

Rice kernels were initially conditioned to three equilibrium relative humidities (ERH) of 46, 62, and 80%, and then were exposed to high relative humidity (RH) environments of 65, 86, and 100% for different periods. All experiments were conducted at 21$\sp\circ$C. Results showed that grains equilibrated to 46 and 62% ERH would fissure when exposed to either 86 or 100% RH. For rice grains at 46% ERH, the cumulative percentage of fissured kernels (CPFK) increased as the exposure humidity increased with all of the kernels fissuring at 100% exposure humidity. The CPFK decreased sharply as the initial moisture level increased with no kernels developing fissures when rice grains at 80% ERH were exposed to 86 and 100% RH. The cumulative number of fissures (CNF) in rice grains increased with exposure RH and exposure time.  The retardation times were analyzed by using the experimental values and finite element techniques. The moisture adsorption rates (MAR) for different forms of rice and RH were determined. The experimental results were compared with the finite element analysis. The moisture gradients in a rice kernel during moisture adsorption were calculated.  The causes and characteristics of rice fissures from moisture stresses were investigated. The finite element method was used to obtain numerical solutions to the moisture diffusion equation and stress-strain relationship equation. Therefore, two finite element models were derived from the mathematical analysis. The first model solved the moisture diffusion within the rice kernel while the second simulated the internal expansion and contraction of the kernel and evaluated the magnitude of the local strains and stresses.  The three major stress components, namely axial, radial, and tangential stresses were studied in relation to failure tensile strength and local strain energy density of distortion by the finite element program. Axial stresses are the primary reason for fissures to develop in a rice kernel; tangential stresses may cause a rice grain to fissure parallel to the longitudinal axis; radial stresses do not cause a rice grain to fissure. The largest tensile stresses occur at the center of a kernel where the fissure usually starts.","Ph.

However, TCDD inhibited E2-induced pS2 mRNA steady-state levels and the constitutive expresion of HER -2/neu receptor mRNA steady-state levels were suppressed after TCDD-treatment. TCDD-inhibited or suppressed E2-induced expression of immediate early oncogenes c-myc and c-fos and TPA and E2-induced AP-l-TRE binding. Alternatively, treatment of MCF-7 cells with TPA-inhibited TCDD-induced AhR-DRE binding and expression of Fos oncoprotein suppressed TCDD dependent AhR transactivation of a CAT reporter gene in both MCF-7 and Hepa 1c1c7 cells. Moreover, in Hepa 1c1c 7 cells, Fos and Jun inhibited the formation of a TCDD-dependent AhR-DRE complex and AhR was precipitated with Fos antibodies. These results were consistent with the formation of a nuclear Ah receptor-Fos complex and support a novel mechanism to explain some fo the antimitogenic and antiestrogenic effects of TCDD.","Ph.
