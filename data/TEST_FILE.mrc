The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) observed in the generation of Ch3 radicals exhibited a dependence on the residence time in the post-reaction zone. Metal oxides differ greatly with respect to their reactivities with Ch3 radicals. Oxides in which the cations exhibit accessible multivalent oxidation states are highly reactive. The reactions of CH3 radicals with these metal oxides are believed to take place via a mechanism in which cations are reduced as a result of the electron transfer from CH3 radicals. The reactions are characterized by small activation energies and sticking coefficients that result from either electron-tunneling or a direct electron transfer which is limited by the weak adsorption of CH3 radicals. The methoxide ions that are produced ultimately form CO2 and CO via formate ions. The addition of Na2CO3 to La2O3, CeO2 and Tb2O3 has marked effect on the catalytic properties of these materials. The effect is most dramatic for CeO2, which, upon addition on Na2CO3, is transformed from a total oxidation catalyst to a reasonably selective catalyst for the formation of C2+ hydrocarbons. A sodium carbonate/oxide phase largely covers the lanthanide oxide surface. Accordingly, the Na/Ln[x]O[y] catalysts are similar to pure Na2CO3 with respect to their catalytic properties. The sodium compound inhibit reactions between CH3 radicals and the underlying metal oxide and provide a new active species, Na2O2. The active and selective NaMnO4/MgO catalyst also was partially covered with a sodium carbonate/oxide phase. Two phases may be responsible for the good performance of the catalyst: a crystalline phase of the structure of Mg6MnO8 and a sodium phase on the surface. The formation of the former is promoted by the presence of Na+ ions. The role of the sodium phase is the same as in Na/Ln[x]O[y] catalysts. 0aMethanexOxidation. 0aMetallic oxides. 0aCatalysis. 4aMajor chemistry. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLunsford, Jack H.,edegree supervisor.1 aSnthony, Rayford G.,edegree committee member.1 aGoodman, Wayne D.,edegree committee member.1 aRosynek, Michael P.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.423ProQuest, Abstractuhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:913401241xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1229781zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=747613901&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy  aC0bTXAffs135d6c5e-0dbd-32f6-b985-5933e6a8e04ci008879bd-afba-3b60-863e-5a26286d54a504173ctm a2200421Ka 4500001001400000005001700014008004100031035002300072035001400095040003000109035002000139049000900159099002900168100002200197245009600219264001000315300004600325336002600371337002800397338002700425504004100452500001000493502004100503500003900544520241200583650002802995655002703023700004003050700004803090700004603138700005103184710005803235856015603293856007803449856013303527994001203660999007903672in0000129906720200904152729.0960603s1994    xx a     bm   000 0 eng d  a(OCoLC)ocm34846108  9AHA5816AM  aTXAbengcTXAdOCLCQdTXA  a(OCoLC)34846108  aTXAM  a1994aDissertationaH2521 aHao, Ying,d1964-10aResource management in high-speed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks /cby Ying Hao. 1c1994.  axii, 130 leaves :billustrations ;c28 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aVita.  bPh.

Since a broadband network has a high bandwidth-delay product, preventive resource managem ent schemes have to be designed to ensure th e probability of network congestion being held below a certain value. Despite preventive schemes, network congestion may still occur due to aggregated and focussed loads. Hence, an adaptive m angem ent scheme should be designed as a compliment to preventive schemes. Admission control is used as a preventive scheme which decides w hether or not to accept a connection upon its request. A m ajor undertaking in the design of such a scheme is the com putational complexity, and an admission control scheme has to make a trade-off between its time-complexity and accuracy. In the Average Renewal Cycle model, the average behavior of the traffic stream in its renewal cycle is formulated, based on which an upper bound on the cell loss probability is obtained. The Resource Decomposition model utilizes the performance model of each individual source in isolation to infer its behavior in a multiplexed traffic stream. The proposed approaches have an advantage over the existing ones in th at they have higher accuracy but almost equal processing overhead. Moreover, the second model can be applied to different cell discarding schemes, which cannot be done in any of the existing approaches. To protect th e transmission quality of information sources in the face of link overload, we propose and evaluate a burst-level adaptive resource m anagem ent scheme. Our scheme reacts to overload situations in an output port by reallocating the resources of the port among th e active sources. Since the network congestion is mainly caused by burst-level traffic fluctuations, the proposed scheme is shown to be effective in protecting the service quality of information sources. The ATM network is developed to support a large variety of application systems. The interplay between the ATM network and these systems is critical for their development. As a case study, m edia synchronization schemes in a distributed m ultimedia systems are examined. We quantify and analyze the correlation between the synchronization quality and the ATM network to provide an insight into the the interplay between th e ATM network and the distributed multimedia system. 4aMajor computer science. 7aAcademic theses2lcgft1 aLiu, Jyh-Charn,edegree supervisor.1 aBhuyan, Laxmi N.,edegree committee member.1 aKim, Junguk L.,edegree committee member.1 aFeldman, Richard M.,edegree committee member.2 aTexas A & M University,edegree granting institution.41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741324931&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQDzLink to OAKTrust copy41xhttp://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/DISSERTATIONS-1554377zLink to OAKTrust copy41uhttp://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=741324931&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=2945&RQT=309&VName=PQD  aC0bTXAffsb387d462-20b9-3300-9426-dfb3da0bd885i0094c066-62d2-3f69-9278-857b3a0eb7ad
